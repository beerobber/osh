In depths of despair, I cry, “Lord, save!” Dull tears flood my eyes, Lord, from Thee, This darkness surrounds my soul as the grave; Art Thou, Oh Lord, ever near me? 

Oh Lord, hear my voice, hear my prayer, Attend to the cries of my need. My sins, so dark, I cannot bear. Oh, Lord, art Thou ever near me? 

Is there still forgiveness with Thee, Lord? I fear that my soul should e’er grieve. I wait upon Thee, I trust in Thy word; Perhaps, Oh Lord, Thou art near me. 

My soul waits for Thee more than morning; The sun cannot spare or give mercy; The only hope for Israel is Thee, And is that hope for me? 

Dear soul, look thou up to the heavens; Thy help and thy pardon to see; The blood of His grace is full redemption For Jesus has always been near thee.
