Assist Thy servant, Lord, The gospel to proclaim;Let pow’r and love attend the word,And ev’ry breast inflame,And ev’ry breast inflame.

Bid unbelief depart, With love his soul inflame;Take full possession of his heart,And glorify Thy name,And glorify Thy name.

May stubborn sinners bend To Thy divine control;Constrain the wand’ring to attend,And make the wounded whole,And make the wounded whole.
