I was wand'ring in sin, far away from home,Loads of darkness swept down on my soul;Then Jesus, my Savior in mercy did come,Bringing grace that can never be told.

The love of my Savior grows sweeter each day,As the sorrows of life press me sore;For He paid all my debts on Calvary's tree,And my sins, yes, forever, He bore.

It is grace which has bro't sweetest peace to my soul,And courage to serve Him in love;If the winters be dreary and cold here below,Let me onward go looking above.

Now the clouds of war have gathered around,O the horrors bear down on my soul;But His grace will still keep me secure on my way,And will land me in heaven, my goal.



Grace! grace!ÊWonderful grace,That comes from the Father above,May Jesus our Savior, forever, I pray,

Hold me fast in the arms of His love.

Marvelous grace, yes,
