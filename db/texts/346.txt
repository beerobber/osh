Hail the blest morn, see the great Mediator, Down from the regions of glory descend! Shepherds, go worship the Babe in the manger, Lo, for His guard the bright angels attend.

Cold on His cradle the dewdrops are shining; Low lies His bed with the beasts of the stall; Angels adore Him, in slumbers reclining, Wise men and shepherds before Him will fall.

Say, shall we yield Him, in costly devotion, Odors of Eden, and off’rings divine, Gems from the mountain and pearls from the ocean, Myrrh from the forest, and gold from the mine?

Vainly we offer each earthly oblation, Vainly with gold we His favor secure; Richer by far is the heart’s adoration, Dearer to God are the prayers of the poor.

Low at His feet we in humble prostration Lose all our trouble and sorrow and strife; There we receive His divine consolation, Flowing afresh from the fountain of life.

He is our Friend in the midst of temptation, Faithful supporter Whose love cannot fail, Rock of our refuge, and Hope of salvation, Light to direct us thru death’s gloomy vale.

Brightest and best of the sons of the morning!Dawn on our darkness, and lend us Thine aid; Star in the East, the horizon adorning, Guide where our infant Redeemer was laid.
