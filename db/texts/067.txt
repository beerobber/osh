I will sing the wondrous story Of the Christ who died for me,How He left His home in gloryFor the cross of Calvary.

I was lost, but Jesus found me,Found the sheep that was astray,Threw His loving arms around me,Drew me back into His way.

I was bruised, but Jesus healed me,Faint was I from manyIa fall;Sight was gone, and fears possessed me,But He freed me from them all.

Days of darkness still come o’er me,Sorrow’s paths I often tread,But the Savior still is with me,By His hand I’m safely led.

He will keep me till the riverRolls its waters at my feet,Then He’ll bear me safely over,Where the loved ones I shall meet.



Yes, I’ll sing the wondrous storyOf the Christ who died for me;Sing it with the saints in glory,Gathered by the crystal sea. 

Yes, I’ll sing the wondrous story Of the Christ who died for me; Sing it with the saints in glory, Gathered by the crystal sea.
