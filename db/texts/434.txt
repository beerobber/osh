When the storm in its fury on Galilee fell,And lifted its waters on high,And the faithless disciples were bound in the spell,Jesus whispered, "Fear not, it is I."
The storm could not bury that word in the wave,'Twas taught thru the tempest to fly.It shall reach His disciples in every age,Saying, "Be not afraid, it is I."
When the spirit is broken with sorrow and care,And comfort is ready to die,Then  darkness shall pass, and the sunshine appear,By the life-giving word, "It is I."

When death is at hand, and this cottage of clayIs left with a tremulous sigh,The gracious Redeemer will light all the way,Saying, "Be not afraid, it is I."





"It is I, it is I,Fear not, trembling one, it is I."In the midst of the storm,

In the midst of the gloom,









D.S.Ð"Fear not, trembling one, it is I."
