Jesus, before Thy face I fall,My Lord, my life, my hope, my all;For I have nowhere else to flee,No sanctuary, Lord, but Thee.

In Thee I ev’ry glory view,Of safety, strength, and beauty, too;Beloved Savior, ever be A sanctuary unto me.

Whatever woes and fears betide,In Thy dear bosom let me hide;And, while I pour my soul to Thee,Do Thou my sanctuary be.

Thru life and all its changing scenes,And all the grief that intervenes;’Tis this supports my fainting heart,That Thou my sanctuary art.
