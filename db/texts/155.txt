How can I, a lowly mortal, Born an earthling formed of clay,ÊSeek to praise the Lord Jehovah, Who has turned my night to day?ÊHow can such a one of Adam, Long estranged from God above,ÊHope to find His blessed favor, Hope to know His blessed love?Ê

For His eye is far too pure to Look upon this earthly frame;ÊHis own perfect Being never Can accept my sin and shame.ÊOh, that I knew where to seek Him, Oh, that He might smile on me,ÊBut unless my sin is covered, Such a joy can never be.

But, oh, listen, do you hear it? Do you hear that glad new song?ÊIt is telling how the Savior Has been sent to claim His own.ÊBlessed Jesus died to save me, Save me from the fatal sting;ÊNow I know that He's my Savior, Praises to my Lord and King! Amen.
