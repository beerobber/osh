Out in the cold world away from God, No signs of where man's feet have trod; With broken heart I tried to pray That God would take my sins away. 

All of my prayers were chattering words! And really felt they were not heard; The more I felt to be denied, The more I prayed, the more I cried. 

In sinfulness away from home, Spirit all broken and alone; No one to care, no place to flee, Where will I spend eternity? 

The answer came as I gave up, About to drink the bitter cup, That Jesus died on Calv'ry's tree To save poor sinners just like me. 

And now I'm singing on my way, That Jesus washed my sins away; And as I live I want to tell, That Jesus has done all things well.
