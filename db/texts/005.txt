O, for a thousand tongues to sing My great Redeemer’s praise,The glories of my God and King, The triumphs of His grace.

My gracious Master and my God, Assist me to proclaim,To spread thru all the earth abroad The honors of Thy name.

Jesus! the name that calms our fears, That bids our sorrows cease;’Tis music in the sinner’s ears, ’Tis life and health and peace.

He breaks the pow’r of canceled sin, He sets the pris’ner free;His blood can make the foulest clean; His blood availed for me. 





Lord, in Thy presence here we meet;May we in Thee be found!O make the place divinely sweet,And let Thy grace abound.

With harmony Thy servants bless,That we may own to TheeHow good, how sweet, how pleasant ’tisWhen brethren all agree.

May Zion’s good be kept in view,And bless our feeble aim,That all we undertake to doMay glorify Thy name.
