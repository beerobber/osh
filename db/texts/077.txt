O Lord my God! when I in awesome wonderConsider all the worlds Thy hands have made;I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,Thy pow’r throughout the universe displayed.

When thru the woods and forest glades I wanderAnd hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees;When I look down from lofty mountain grandeurAnd hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze.

And when I think that God, His Son not sparing,Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,He bled and died to take away my sin.

When Christ shall come with shout of acclamationAnd take me home, what joy shall fill my heart!Then I shall bow in humble adorationAnd there proclaim, my God, how great Thou art!





Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee;How great Thou art, how great Thou art!Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee;How great Thou art, how great Thou art!











“Man of Sorrows,” what a nameFor the Son of God who cameRuined sinners to reclaim,Hallelujah, what a Savior!

Bearing shame and scoffing rude,In my place condemned he stood;Sealed my pardon with His blood,Hallelujah, what a Savior!

Lifted up was He to die,“It is finished,” was His cry;Now in Heav’n exalted high:Hallelujah, what a Savior!

When He comes, our glor’ous King,All His ransomed home to bring,Then anew this song we’ll sing:Hallelujah, what a Savior!
