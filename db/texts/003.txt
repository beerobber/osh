Come, let us praise the Lord, And seek for His reward; His love is pure and will endure,As told us in His word.

Dear Lord, we love Thy way,And would Thy word obey;Enable us to take our crossAnd serve Thee day by day.

Prepare us for our race,And cleanse us by Thy grace;Oh, let us come to Thy great throne,And stand before Thy face.

Our Savior bids us come,And nevermore to roam;And with the blest we shall find restUntil He takes us home.

















Praise God, from whom all blessings flow; Praise Him, all creatures here below; Praise Him above ye heav’nly host; Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost. Amen.
