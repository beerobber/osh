Climbing up the mountain with knife and wood in hand,Isaac asked his father, "Behold, where is the Lamb?"Hear old Abram's answer thro' all of time it standsHe said, "My son, God will provide Himself a lamb."

To the Temple mountain the people came to see,"Will God accept our lamb? Will He be pleased with me?"Tho' spotless lambs were offered to meet the law's demands,No lamb in all the flocks could pay the price for sin.

Now view Calv'ry's mountain, by faith behold the scene:Wicked wolves have nailed Him the Lamb hangs on the tree!By men despised, rejected, but God was satisfied!The Lamb of God accepted; Behold sin's sacrifice!



God will provide Himself a lamb!ÊBehold this truth of God still stands!Perfect, spotless, great I AMGod will provide Himself a Lamb!

God will provide, provide Himself a lamb! Behold God's truth still stands! Perfect, spotless, great I AM
