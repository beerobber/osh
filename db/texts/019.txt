Come, we that love the Lord,And let our joys be known,Join in a song with sweet accord,Join in a song with sweet accord,And thus surround the throne,And thus surround the throne.

Let those refuse to sing Who never knew our God;But children of the heav’nly King,But children of the heav’nly King,May speak their joys abroad,May speak their joys abroad.

The hill of Zion yieldsA thousand sacred sweetsBefore we reach the heav’nly fields,Before we reach the heav’nly fields,Or walk the golden streets,Or walk the golden streets.

Then let our songs abound,And ev’ry tear be dry;We’re marching thru Immanuel’s ground,We’re marching thru Immanuel’s ground,To fairer worlds on high,To fairer worlds on high.





We’re marching to Zion,Beautiful, beautiful Zion;We’re marching upward to Zion,The beautiful city of God.

1. And thus surround the throne, And thus surround the throne. 

We’re marching on to Zion, Zion, Zion, 







Awake and sing the song Of Moses and the Lamb;Wake ev’ry heart and ev’ry tongueTo praise the Savior’s name.

Sing of His dying love,Sing of His risen pow’r;Sing how He intercedes aboveFor those whose sins He bore.

Sing till we feel our heartsAscending with our tongues;Sing till the love of sin departs,And grace inspires our hearts.

Soon we shall hear Him say,Ye blessed children, come;Soon will He call us hence away,And take His wand’rers home.
