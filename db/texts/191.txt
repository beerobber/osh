There is one mediator between the Lord and men, Christ Jesus was our Daysman: our sins were laid on Him. 

Wounded for our transgressions, and chastised for our peace, Yet God was pleased to bruise Him for our iniquities. 

O'er Cedron's bloody river, the Lamb crossed o'er to pray. ÒThy will not mine be done, Lord,Ó O hear the Savior say! 

Soon with the sun's light darkened, The Daysman would begin; To bear God's wrath upon Him, and make an end of sin. 

He stood when we were fallen, Paid what we could not pay; His life made intercession, He bore our sins away. 

With final breaths approaching, He cried aloud that day; His death then sealed our pardon, He triumphed o'er the grave. 

With one hand on the heavens and one hand on the earth, He satisfied the wrath of God, Our Daysman stood for us.
