How vast the benefits divine, Which we in Christ possess; We're saved from guilt and ev'ry sin, And called to holiness. 

'Tis not for works which we have done, Or shall hereafter do, But He of His abounding love Salvation does bestow. 

The glory, Lord, from first to last, Is due to Thee alone: Aught to ourselves we dare not take, Or rob Thee of Thy crown. 

Our glorious Surety undertook Redemption's wondrous plan; And grace was given us in Him Before the world began. 

Safe in the arms of sov'reign love We ever shall remain; Nor shall the rage of earth or hell Make Thy dear counsels vain. 

Not one of all the chosen race, But shall to heav'n attain; Partake on earth the purposed grace, And then with Jesus reign.
