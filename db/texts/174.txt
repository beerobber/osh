O Thou God of my salvation,My Redeemer from all sin;Moved by Thy divine compassion,Who has died my heart to win,I will praise Thee, I will praise Thee;Where shall I Thy praise begin?

Tho’ unseen, I love the Savior;He hath bro’t salvation near;Manifests His pard’ning favor;And when Jesus doth appear,Soul and body, soul and bodyShall His glor’ous image bear.

While the angel choirs are saying,“Glory to the great I AM,”I with them will still be vying,Glory, glory to the Lamb!O how precious, O how preciousIs the sound of Jesus’ name!

Angels now are hov’ring round us,Unperceived amid the throng;Wond’ring at the love that crowned us,Glad to join the holy song;Hallelujah, hallelujah,Love and praise to Christ belong!
