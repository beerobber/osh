Amid the sorrows of the way,Thru starless night and cloudy day,This is my hope, my only stay,The Lord remembers me.

The cares of life are crowding fast,And o’er my way their shadows cast,But this supports me to the last,The Lord remembers me.

Then on Him let me cast my care,His guidance and support to share,I’ll never sink in dark despair,For He remembers me.

The billows ’round me no more foam,The Lord above has bid me come,And now at rest in that sweet home, He still remembers me.





The Lord remembers me,The Lord remembers me,D.S.–I need not fear if He is near,And still remembers me.

4th–I’ve no more fear for He is near,And still remembers me.
