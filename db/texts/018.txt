Oh, dear pilgrim are you troubledBy the darkness of the way?Do your sorrows and your burdensFill your heart with dark dismay?Do your toils and tears and troublesGrieve your heart from day to day?Does your soul in meditationOften long to fly away?

Then, oh, listen to your SaviorAs He kindly, sweetly calls,ÒCome to Me, ye heavy laden,ÊI will take your burdens all;Come and take My yoke upon you,Learn of me from day to day;Listen to My loving counsel,I will help you all the way.Ó

On the road from earth to gloryMany pitfalls do abide;Satan often darkens counsel,ÊAnd the pitfalls often hide.ÒI will lead you on your journeyIn your travels here below;I will guide your feeble footstepsThru this vale of sin and woe.Ó

Thus the Savior gives His counselTo His children here on earth,For He loves each one so dearlyThat for them He gave His life.Then, oh, then we all should listenTo His words so kind and true,Walk with Him and seek His presenceDay by day the journey thru.

Some sweet day we hope to see HimIn that home above the sky,Wholly by His grace and favor,We shall see Him by and by.Then let's listen to His counsel,For He too has passed this way,And will soon return from heaven,Then to take us home to stay.
