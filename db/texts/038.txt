Fairest Lord Jesus,Ruler of all nature,O Thou of God and man the Son,Thee will I cherish,Thee will I honor,Thou my soul’s glory, joy, and crown.

Fair are the meadows,Fairer still the woodlands,Robed in the blooming garb of spring;Jesus is fairer,Jesus is purer,Who makes the woeful heart to sing.

Fair is the sunshine,Fairer still the moonlight,And all the twinkling, starry host;Jesus shines brighter,Jesus shines purer,Than all the angels heav’n can boast. 







Poor, weak, and worthless tho’ I am,I have a rich Almighty Friend;Jesus, the Savior is His name,He freely loves and without end.

He ransomed me from hell with blood,And by His pow’r my foes controlled,He found me wand’ring far from God,And bro’t me to His chosen fold.

He cheers my heart, my want supplies,And says that I shall shortly be,Enthroned with Him above the skies;O what a Friend is Christ to me!







Jesus, before Thy face I fall,My Lord, my life, my hope, my all;For I have nowhere else to flee,No sanctuary, Lord, but Thee.

In Thee I ev’ry glory view,Of safety, strength, and beauty, too;Beloved Savior, ever be A sanctuary unto me.

Whatever woes and fears betide,In Thy dear bosom let me hide;And, while I pour my soul to Thee,Do Thou my sanctuary be.

Thru life and all its changing scenes,And all the grief that intervenes;’Tis this supports my fainting heart,That Thou my sanctuary art.
