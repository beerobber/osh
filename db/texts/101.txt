I love the sons of grace,The heirs of bliss divine,Who walk in paths of righteousness,And fly from ev'ry sin.
They will my faults reprove,When heedlessly I err;How do I prize their faithful love,Their kind and tender care!

They Jesus' image bear,How lovely is the sight!They shall at length with Him appearIn everlasting light.

They love the Father's name,And gladly do His will;They humbly follow Christ, the Lamb,In righteousness and zeal.
