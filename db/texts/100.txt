How did my heart rejoice to hearMy friends devoutly say,“In Zion let us all appear,And keep the solemn day!”

I love her gates; I love the road;The Church, adorned with grace,Stands like a palace built for GodTo show His milder face.

Up to her courts, with joys unknown,The holy tribes repair,The Son of David holds His throne,And sits in judgement there.

He hears our praises and complaints,And while His awful voiceDivides the sinners from the saints,We tremble and rejoice.

Peace be within this sacred place,And joy a constant guest;With holy gifts and heav’nly graceBe her attendants blest!

My soul shall pray for Zion still,While life or breath remains;There my best friends, my kindred dwell,There God, my Savior, reigns.
