My soul is not at ease; my heart cannot find rest; The burdens of the world do lay   upon my weary chest. 

The adversary comes and causes me to fear; My mind is filled with hate and lies, but still my Lord is near. 

 Was it for me He died and gave to me His love? Elected by my Father's grace to live with Him above! 

With His wounds I am healed, and by His death I'm blessed To stand before Him free of blame. Thus in Him I should rest. 

He takes my hand in His; He wipes my tears away; In Him I am complete and loved!  My sins He all forgave. 



 My soul is not at ease my heart cannot find rest The burdens of the world do lay upon my weary chest. world do lay upon my weary chest.
