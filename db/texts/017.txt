I love to see the Lord below,His church displays His grace;But upper worlds His glory know,And view Him face to face.

I love to worship at His feet,Tho’ sin annoy me there;But saints exalted near His seatHave no assaults to fear.

I love to meet Him in His courts,And taste His heav’nly love;But still His visits seem too short,Or I too soon remove.

O Lord, I love Thy service now;Thy church displays Thy pow’r;But soon in heav’n I’ll to Thee bow,And praise Thee evermore.
