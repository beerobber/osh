Holy, holy, holy! Lord God almighty!Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee;Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty!God in three Persons, blessed Trinity!


Holy, holy, holy! all the saints adore Thee,Casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea;Cherubim and seraphim falling down before Thee,Who wert, and art, and evermore shalt be.


Holy, holy, holy! tho' the darkness hide Thee,Tho' the eye of sinful man Thy glory may not see;Only Thou art holy; there is none beside Thee,Perfect in pow'r, in love, and purity.

Holy, holy, holy! Lord God almighty!All Thy works shall praise Thy name, in earth, and sky, and sea;Holy, holy, holy; merciful and mighty!God in three Persons, blessed Trinity!
