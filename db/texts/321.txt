Lord, how sweet 'tis to see the dear ones follow TheeIn a service of love here below;There's no tongue can portray the sweet peace of this way,And the blessing you do here bestow.

Such a peace, we are told, is more precious than gold,For their treasures are laid up above;With the saints they live high, and on Christ they rely,As they feast on His blessings of love.

Now, dear children, we wish you to share in this bliss,As you go bear the yoke and the cross;Yoke is soft, burden light, follow Him with delight,For with  Jesus no service is lost.

Quiet peace comes the day that you start in this way;Rest is found all the journey along;Rest in peace and at home, why not then to Him come,Praise the Lord in your deeds and your song?

Then the sorrows and tears that shall come later years,All are made easy for you to bear;So then why will you roam from this dear, peaceful home,And no joys with the saints here to share?
