Tears flood my eyes, I cry to Thee, Incline Thine ear, I pray;I mourn because my enemies cast down upon me hate.

Lord, is Your arm stretched out for me? Will You attend my cries?I know I'm saved eternally, but here am I to die?

My heart is sore and pained within, o'erwhelmed and beaten down;King, hear my cry, and let me see My heart is no more bound!

And even in my unbelief, Yet He in faith abides;For His foundation standeth sure, Himself He can't deny!


Lord, I believe! Lord, I believe, help Thou mine unbelief;I cry to Thee, Lord, I believe, help Thou mine unbelief!
