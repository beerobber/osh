Behold the mount of Zion, The city of our God!The beauty of creation,And place of His abode.Christ is the great foundationOn which the building stands;He reared for his own gloryThis temple without hands.

Thru everlasting agesThis house shall stand secure:The Lord for it engagesHis wisdom, love, and pow'r;Nor shall the hosts of SatanAgainst it e'er prevail,Tho' kingdoms be demolished,And heav'n and earth should fail.

The Rock on which it's foundedWill last without decay;With walls it is surrounded,Which guard it ev'ry way;Each stone is wisely polished,And fitted to its place;And all are well cementedWith God's redeeming grace.

Nor storms nor persecutions Shall ever beat it down,Nor floods of tribulationShall move a single stone;With Christ they all shall triumphO'er sin and death and hell,And with Him in His gloryThey shall forever dwell.
