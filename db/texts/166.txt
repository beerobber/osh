My Lord, I did not choose You,For that could never be;My heart would still refuse You,Had You not chosen me.You took the sin that stained me,You cleansed me, made me new;Of old You have ordained me,That I should live in You.

Unless Your grace had called meAnd taught my op'ning mind,The world would have enthralled me;To heav'nly glories blind.My heart knows none above You,For Your rich grace I thirst;I know that if I love You,You must have loved me first.

Your love has been forever,From all eternity;Its drawing power neverShall be withdrawn from me;I feel that I am kept by The strength of love divine,And when I wake in Heaven,All glory shall be Thine.
