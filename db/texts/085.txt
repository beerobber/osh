When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were as those who fondly dream. Then our mouths filled with laughter, our tongues with song: Our praise flowed in joyful streams. 

We will lift up our eyes to the mountains of Glory, for our help comes from God above. Our feet shall not stumble, nor shall we fall; we will rest in His tender love. 

Let us worship our God in the House of Jehovah; let us break bread with joyful song! Let us steadfastly preach, fellowship, and pray in Zion for evermore!
