Oh, once I had a glor’ous viewOf my redeeming Lord,He said, “I’ll be a God to you,” And I believed His word.But now I have a deeper strokeThan all my groanings are;My God has me of late forsook,He’s gone I know not where.

Oh, what immortal joys I feltOn that celestial day,When my hard heart began to melt,By love dissolved away;But my complaint is bitter now, For all my joys are gone,I’ve strayed! I’m left! I know not how,The light’s from me withdrawn.

Once I rejoiced the saints to meet,To me they were most dear,I then could stoop to wash their feet,And shed a joyful tear;But now I meet them as the rest, And with them joyless stay,My conversation’s spiritless, Or else I’ve naught to say.

I forward go in duty’s way,But can’t perceive Him there,Then backward on the road I stray, But cannot find Him there;On the left hand, where He doth work,Among the wicked crew,And on the right, I find Him not,Among the favored few.

What shall I do; Shall I lie down,And sink in deep despair?Will He forever wear a frown,Nor hear my feeble prayer?No; He will put His strength in me,He knows the way I’ve strolled,And when I’m tried sufficiently,I shall come forth as gold.
