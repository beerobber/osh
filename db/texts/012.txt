Kindred in Christ, for His dear sake,A hearty welcome here receive;May we together now partakeThe joys which only He can give.

May He by whose kind care we meetSend His good Spirit from above;Make our communications sweet,And cause our hearts to burn with love.

Forgotten be each worldly themeWhen Christians meet together thus;We only wish to speak of HimWho lived, and died, and reigns for us.

We’ll talk of all He did and said,And suffered for us here below;The path He marked for us to tread,And what He’s doing for us now.

Thus as the moments pass away, We’ll love, and wonder, and adore;And hasten on that glor’ous dayWhen we shall meet to part no more.
