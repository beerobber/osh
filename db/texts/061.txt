I will call upon the Lord,Who is worthy to be praised;So shall I be saved from mine enemies.

Who is God except the Lord?Who a rock beside our God?To a higher place He delivered me.

So will I give thanks to Thee,And sing praises to Thy name.Be exalted, Lord, in Thy mighty pow’r.







The Lord liveth, and blessed be my Rock;And let the God of my salvation be exalted!The Lord liveth, and blessed be my Rock;And let the God of my salvation be exalted!











I will call upon the Lord,Who is worthy to be praised;So shall I be saved from mine enemies.

Who is God except the Lord?Who a rock beside our God?To a higher place He delivered me.
