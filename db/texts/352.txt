When overwhelmed with doubts and fear,Great God, do Thou my spirit cheer;Let not mine eyes with tears be fed,But to the Rock of Ages led.

When storms of sin and sorrow beat,Lead me to this divine retreat;Thy perfect righteousness and blood,My Rock, my Fortress, and my God.

When guilt lies heavy on my soul,And waves of fierce temptation roll,I'll to the Rock for shelter flee,And take my refuge, Lord, in Thee.

When called the vale of death to tread,Then to the Rock may I be led;Nor fear to cross that gloomy sea,Since Thou hast tasted death for me.
