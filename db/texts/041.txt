Hark! the jubilee is sounding,Oh, the joyful news is come:Free salvation is proclaimedIn and thru God's holy Son.Now we have complete redemptionThru the meek and lowly Lamb;Now let each one cease from wand'ring,Come and follow Christ, the Way;We shall all receive a blessingIf from Him we do not stray.Golden moments we've neglected,Yet the Lord forgives again;
Come, let us run our race with patience,Looking unto Christ, the Lord,Who doth live and reign foreverWith His Father and our God.He is worthy to be praised,He is our exalted King;

Come, dear children, praise your Jesus,Praise Him, praise Him, evermore;May His great love now constrain usSo His great name we'll adore.Oh, then let us join together,His wondrous name to proclaim;

Glory, honor, and salvation,Christ, the Lord is come to reign!
