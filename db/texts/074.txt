O God, our help in ages past,Our hope for years to come,Our shelter from the stormy blast,And our eternal home!

Under the shadow of Thy throneStill may we dwell secure;Sufficient is Thine arm alone,And our defense is sure.

Before the hills in order stood,Or earth received her frame,From everlasting Thou art God,To endless years the same.

O God, our help in ages past,Our hope for years to come,Be Thou my guide while life shall last,And our eternal home.
