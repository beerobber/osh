O may I worthy prove to seeThy saints in full prosperity;To see the Bride, the glitt'ring Bride,Close seated by the Savior's side.

O may I find some humble seatBeneath my dear Redeemer's feet!A servant as before He's been,I'll sing salvation to my King.

I'm glad that I am born to die,From grief and woe my soul shall fly;Bright angels shall convey me homeUnto the new Jerusalem.

I'll praise Him while He gives me breath,I hope to praise Him after death,I hope to praise Him when I die,And shout salvation as I fly.
