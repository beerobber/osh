Time! what an empty vapor ’tis!And days, how swift they are!Swift as an Indian arrow flies,Or like a shooting star.

The present moments just appear,Then slide away in haste,That we can never say, “They’re here,”But only say, “They’re past.”

Our life is ever on the wing, And death is ever nigh;The moment when our lives beginWe all begin to die.

Yet, mighty God! our fleeting daysThy lasting favors share,Yet with the bounties of Thy graceThou loadst the rolling year.
