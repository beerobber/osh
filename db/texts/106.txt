You may sing of the beauty of mountain and dale,Of the silvery streamlet and flow’rs of the vale;But the place most delightful this earth can affordIs the place of devotion — the house of the Lord. 

You may boast of the sweetness of day’s early dawn,Of the sky’s soft’ning graces when day is just gone;But there’s no other season or time can compareWith the house of devotion — the season of pray’r.

You may value the friendships of youth and of age,And select for my comrades the noble and sage;But the friends that most cheer me on life’s rugged roadAre the friends of my Master — the children of God.

You may talk of your prospects of fame or of wealth,And the hopes that oft flatter the fav’rites of health;But the hope of bright glory, of heavenly bliss!Take away ev’ry other, and give me but this.

Ever hail, blessed temple, abode of my God,I will turn to thee often to hear from His word;I will walk to the altar with those that I love,And delight in the prospect revealed from above.
