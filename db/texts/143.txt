Alas! and did my Savior bleed,And did my Sov'reign die?Would He devote His sacred headFor such a worm as I? 

Was it for crimes that I had done,He groaned upon the tree?Amazing pity, grace unknown,And love beyond degree!

Well might the sun in darkness hide,And shut His glories in,When Christ, the mighty Maker diedFor man, the creature's sin.

But drops of grief can ne'er repayThe debt of love I owe;Here, Lord, I give myself away;'Tis all that I can do.


He loves me, He loves me,He loves me, this I know!

He gave Himself to die for mesuch a worm as cause He loves me so!He gave Himself to die for me, Because He loves me so!
