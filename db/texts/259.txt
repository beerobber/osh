Jesus, keep me near the cross, There a precious fountain;Free to drink, a healing stream, Flows from Calv'ry's mountain.

Near the cross, a trembling soul, Love and mercy found me;There the Bright and Morning Star Sheds its beams around me. 

Near the cross! O Lamb of God, Bring its scenes before me;Help me walk from day to day With its shadows o'er me.

Near the cross! I'll watch and wait, Hoping, trusting ever;Till I reach the golden strand, Just beyond the river.



In the cross, in the cross  Be my glory ever,Till my raptured soul shall find Rest beyond the river.
