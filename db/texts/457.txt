Beneath the sacred throne of God I saw a river rise;The streams were peace and pard’ning blood, Descending from the skies.

Angelic minds cannot explore This deep, unfathomed sea;’Tis void of bottom, brim, or shore, And lost in Deity.

I stood amazed and wondered when, Or why this ocean rose,That wafts salvation down to men, His traitors and His foes.

That sacred flood from Jesus’ veinsWas free to take awayA Mary’s or Manasseh’s stains,Or sins more vile than they.
