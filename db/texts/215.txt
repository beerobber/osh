Jesus, my Lord, my Shepherd, Friend, may all the praise be Thine! Oh, that my lips could sing to Thee what's in this heart of mine! May heav'n and earth, above, beneath, with loud hosannas ring! Thou art the Way, the Truth, the Life, Heaven's all-glorious King!

Before the world began, Thou didst by covenant in Three Choose out the ones to dwell with Thee in vast eternity; Thou hast redeemed us by Thy blood according to Thy grace, And hast imparted to our souls, faith for the present race.

Thou came at the appointed time and groaned upon the tree To bear  the sins of Thy children as God required of Thee, Then broke the bars of death and hell, and rose to victory, And now art sitting on Thy throne to intercede for me.

I know that my Redeemer lives and will return again; I shall behold Him with mine eyes and be rid of my sin; The Lord of Glory, He will speak, and it shall come to pass; We all shall be with God above in peace and joy at last.
