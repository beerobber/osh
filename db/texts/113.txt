Break Thou the bread of life,Dear Lord, to me,As Thou didst break the loavesBeside the sea;Beyond the sacred pageI seek Thee, Lord;My spirit pants for Thee,O living Word.

Bless Thou the truth, dear Lord,To me, to me,As Thou didst bless the breadBy Galilee;Then shall all bondage cease,All fetters fall;And I shall find my peace,My All in all.

Thou art the bread of life,O Lord, to me,Thy holy Word the truthThat saveth me;Give me to eat and liveWith Thee above;Teach me to love Thy truth,For Thou art love.

O send Thy Spirit, Lord,Now unto me,That He may touch my eyes,And make me see:Show me the truth concealedWithin Thy Word,And in Thy Book revealedI see the Lord.

Teach me to live, dear Lord,Only for Thee,As Thy disciples lived in Galilee;Then, all my struggles o’er, Then, vict’ry won,I shall behold Thee, Lord, The Living One.
