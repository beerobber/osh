O love surpassing knowledge! O grace, so full and free!I know that Jesus saves me, And that's enough for me.And that's enough for me, O that's enough for me;

O wonderful salvation! From sin He makes me free!I feel the sweet assurance, And that's enough for me.

O blood of Christ, so precious, Poured out on Calvary!I feel its cleansing power, And that's enough for me.
