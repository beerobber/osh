No matter how dark the night,Or bitter the winds that blow,One touch of the Master's gentle handAnd I am ready to go;I'll go anywhere with Him,Thru tempest or sinking sand,As long as I feel the tender touch, The touch of His gentle hand.

A touch of His gentle handCan strengthen the faintest heart,A touch of His tender hand divine,New hope and love can impart;And so in His name I'll go, And whether on sea or land,I never shall fail if I can feel The touch of His gentle hand.

Wherever I chance to be,Wherever my feet may roam,I'll trust in the Lord's unchanging handTo lead me all the way home;And ever my prayer shall be Till safely at home I stand,That I can just feel His touch so real,The touch of His gentle hand.


One touch of His gentle handMeans more than the world to me,One touch of His gentle handWill make ev'ry shadow flee;I'll not be afraid to goAnd bravely take my stand,With courage and zeal,As long as I feelThe touch of His gentle hand.

One touch of His gentle handMeans more than the world to me,One touch of His gentle handWill make ev'ry shadow flee;I'll not be afraid to goAnd bravely take my stand,With courage and zeal,As long as I feelThe touch of His gentle hand.
