Purer in heart, O God, Help me to be;May I devote my life Wholly to Thee.Watch Thou my wayward feet,Guide me with counsel sweet;Purer in heart, Help me to be.

Purer in heart, O God, Help me to be;Teach me to do Thy will Most lovingly,Be Thou my friend and guide,Let me with Thee abide;Purer in heart, Help me to be.

Purer in heart, O God, Help me to be;That I Thy holy face One day may see;Keep me from secret sin,Reign Thou my soul within,Purer in heart, Help me to be.
