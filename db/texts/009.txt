Hungry, and faint, and poor,Behold us, Lord, again,Assembled at Thy mercy’s door,Thy bounty to obtain.

Thy word invites us nigh,Or we must starve indeed;For we no money have to buy,No righteousness to plead.

The food our spirits want,Thy hand alone can give;O hear the pray’r of faith and grantThat we may eat and live.
