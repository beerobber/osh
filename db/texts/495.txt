All praise to Thee, my God, this night, For all the blessings of the light;Keep me, oh, keep me, King of kings,Beneath Thine own almighty wings!

Forgive me, Lord, for Thy dear Son,The ill that I this day have done;That with the world, myself, and Thee,I, ere I sleep, at peace may be.

Teach me to live that I may dreadThe grave as little as my bed;To die, that this vile body may Rise glor'ous at the awful day.

Oh, may my soul on Thee repose,And may sweet sleep mine eyelids close;Sleep that may me more vig'rous makeTo serve my God when I awake.
