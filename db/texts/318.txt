Take time to be holy,Speak oft with Thy Lord,Abide in Him always,And feed on His Word,Make friends of God’s children,Help those who are weak,Forgetting in nothingHis blessings to seek.

Take time to be holy,The world rushes on;Spend much time in secretWith Jesus alone.By looking to Jesus,Like Him thou shalt be;Thy friends in thy conduct His likeness shall see.

Take time to be holy,Let Him be thy guide,And run not before Him,Whatever betide.In joy or in sorrowStill follow the Lord,And, looking to Jesus,Still trust in His Word.

Take time to be holy,Be calm in thy soul,Each tho’t and each motiveBeneath His control.Thus led by His SpiritTo fountains of love,Thou soon shalt be fittedFor service above.
