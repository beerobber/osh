There's a way that is straitLeading up to the gate,Of that home up in Heaven above;When we land on that shorePain and toil will be o'er,We will dwell there in peace and love.

As we journey below,In this world filled with woe,We are often surrounded with pain;But up there says His word,We will dwell with the Lord,And no one ever mourns again.

We are waiting the day,When we'll be called away,From this dark vale of sin here below;There in mansions above,With the Savior of love,We are waiting the call to go.




Someday, someday,When this life here on earth will be o'er;Someday, someday,We will dwell there on Canaan's shore.

Some happy day, some better day, on earth is o'er; Some happy day, some golden day, on Canaan's shore.
