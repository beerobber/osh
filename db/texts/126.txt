Down by the water side we meetTo tread the path that Jesus trod;His name to us is ever sweet,We follow Him, He is our God.

In Matthew third there we beholdJohn did immerse the Son of God,Laid Him beneath the yielding wave,An emblem of His future grave.

Out of the water up He came,Young converts come to do the same;His resurrection here we see,Our death to sin, our liberty.

Buried in baptism with our Lord,To life we rise, obey His word,And soon our mould’ring dust shall riseLike Him, and meet Him in the skies.

“Go, teach the nations and baptize,”Aloud th’ ascending Jesus cries;Thy precept, Lord, we would obey,And follow Thee without delay.

Come, precious souls, that love the Lord,Fulfill this rite, obey His word,With cheerful hearts join in His praise,And love and serve Him all your days.
