Whene’er you need a friendWho is all wise,On whom you can depend,He satisfies.

When darkness hovers near,And torrents rise,Christ comes the soul to cheer,He satisfies.

Nothing of earth is sure,Vain hope soon dies,Things of the Lord endure,He satisfies.







Christ satisfies the soul,When He has full control;D.S.–On Him your burdens roll,Christ satisfies.
