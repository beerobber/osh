Be Thou my vision,O Lord of my heart;Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art;Thou my best thought, by day or by night,Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.

Be Thou my wisdom,And Thou my true Word;I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;Thou my great Father, I Thy true Son;Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.

Riches I heed not,Nor man's empty praise;Thou mine inheritance, now and always;Thou and Thou only, first in my heart,High King of Heaven, my treasure Thou art.

High King of Heaven,My victory won;May I reach Heaven's joys, bright Heaven's Sun!Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,Still be my vision, O Ruler of all.
