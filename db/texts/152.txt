Guilty nailpierced holy vein,Jesus bore the loss;There was blood with holy pain;Dripping from the cross.

Jesus, Thou hast loved us so,Tho’ we be so gross;Saved us by the living flow,Dripping from the cross.

Sick and faint my soul did seem,Poisoned by sin’s dross;But relief came by the stream,Dripping from the cross.

Tho’tless that for sin I owe,Counted not my loss;Grateful now to view the flow,Dripping from the cross.

Worldly pleasures once my dream,Tempted by their gloss;Till I saw the scarlet stream,Dripping from the cross.



All because He loved us so,He sustained the crimson flow;

D.S. – Keep my heart fixed on Thy woe,Dripping from the cross.
