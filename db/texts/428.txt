As I journey thru the land singing as I go,Pointing souls to Calvary    — to the crimson flow,Many arrows pierce my soul from without, within;But my Lord leads me on, thru Him I must win.

When in service for my Lord dark may be the night,But I’ll cling more close to Him, He will give me light;Satan’s snares may vex my soul, turn my tho’ts aside;But my Lord goes ahead, leads whate’er betide.

When before me billows rise from the mighty deep,Then my Lord directs my bark; He doth safely keep,And He leads me gently on thru this world below;He’s a real Friend to me, O I love Him so.







O I want to see Him, look upon His face;There to sing forever of His saving grace;On the streets of glory let me lift my voice;D.S.–Cares all past, home at last, ever to rejoice.

saving grace;
