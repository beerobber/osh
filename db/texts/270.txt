The centurion sent for the Savior, “Lord, my servant is dying in pain. He is home lying sick and in torment.” Jesus said, “I will come and heal him.” 

The centurion said, “I’m not worthy, Lord, for you to come under my roof; But if you will just speak the word only.” His great faith needed no further proof. 

A sad mother of Canaan came crying, “Have mercy on my daughter, Oh Lord, She is greivously vexed with a devil.” But He answered her no, not a word. 

Again and again she cried, “Help me!” The discipples said, “Send her away.” But crumbs from the Master’s table, Fell to feed a poor beggar that day. 

Now, faith is the fruit of the Spirit, God’s heavenly gift from above. If we use it as Jesus intended, It is great in the sight of the Lord. 

Great faith doesn’t come from our merit, So there will be no boasting by man; It flows from the Lord’s Holy Spirit, When we trust in His kind, loving hands. 



1. Jesus marvelled at his great faith, Not in Israel such faith had He found. He confessed that he was unworthy; Lord in me let such great faith abound.
