Just one more time before the doorOf death would intervene,They gathered there to sup and shareLove's feast in joy serene.

For Christ aspired, strongly desired,ÊTo meet in fellowship hereWith those who talked with Him and walkedAlong each dusty year.

He gave them bread and wine so redAnd told them when they meet,ÒRemember Me when this you see,ÓThen knelt and washed their feet.

When next we meet in mem'ry sweet,Let love and fellowship flow,For this might be the last for meBefore I homeward go.
