I am dwelling on the mountainWhere the golden sunlight gleamsO’er a land of wondrous beauty,Far exceeds my fondest dreams;Where the air is pure, ethereal,Laden with the breath of flow’rs;They are blooming by the fountain,’Neath the amaranthine bow’rs.

I can see far down the mountainWhere I wandered weary years,Often hindered in my journeyBy the ghosts of doubts and fears;Broken vows and disappointmentsThickly sprinkled all the way,But the Spirit led unerringTo the land I hold today.

I am drinking at the fountainWhere I ever would abide,For I’ve tasted life’s pure river,And my soul is satisfied.There’s no thirsting for life’s pleasures,Nor adorning rich and gay,For I’ve found a richer treasure,One that fadeth not away.

Tell me not of heavy crosses,Nor the burdens hard to bear,For I’ve found this great salvationMakes each burden light appear.And I love to follow Jesus,Gladly counting all but dross,Worldly honors all forsakingFor the glory of the cross.

Oh, the cross has wondrous glory!Oh, I’ve proved this to be true,When I’m in the way so narrow,I can see a pathway thru.And how sweetly Jesus whispers,“Take the cross, thou need’st not fear,For I’ve trod the way before thee,And the glory lingers near.”



CHO.–Is not this the land of Beulah,Blessed, blessed land of light,Where the flowers bloom forever,And the sun is always bright?
