Oh, the sweet old gospel story,ÊHow it cheers as years go by!All the way from earth to gloryGod will guide me with His eye.

He who notes the sparrow falling,Rules the countless worlds on high,Is to ev'ry pilgrim calling,"I will guide thee with mine eye."

Storms around us may be sweeping,Thunders crashing in the sky,But if we are in His keeping,He will guide us with His eye.

O ye poor, unloved, forsakenBy the world, to Him draw nigh,Let His promise true be taken:He will guide you with His eye.


He will guide me with His eye;On His promise I rely;All the way from earth to glory,He will guide me with His eye.

He will guide me with His eye, yes, He will guide me with His eye, On his promise yes, I rely; yes, all the way earth to glory, He will guide me, He will guide me with His eye.
