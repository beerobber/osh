Low in the grave He lay, Jesus, my Savior!Waiting the coming day, Jesus, my Lord!

Vainly they watch His bed, Jesus, my Savior!Vainly they seal the dead, Jesus, my Lord!

Death cannot keep his prey, Jesus, my Savior!He tore the bars away, Jesus, my Lord!


Up from the grave He arose,With a mighty triumph o'er His foes;He arose a victor from the dark domain,And He lives forever with His saints to reign.He arose! He arose! Hallelujah! Christ arose!

He arose, He arose, He arose! He arose!
