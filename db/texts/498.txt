In mercy, Lord, remember me,Thru all the hours of night;And grant to me most graciously The safeguard of Thy might.

With cheerful heart I close my eyes,Since Thou wilt not remove;Oh, in the morning let me riseRejoicing in Thy love.

Or if this night should prove my last,And end my transient days,Oh, take me to Thy promised rest,Where I may sing Thy praise.
