Children of the heav’nly King,As ye journey, sweetly sing;Sing your Savior’s worthy praise,Glor’ous in His works and ways.

O ye banished seed, be glad!Christ our Advocate is made;Us to save our flesh assumes,Brother of our souls becomes.

Shout, ye little flock, and blest!You on Jesus’ throne shall rest;There your seat is now prepared,There your kingdom and reward.

Fear not, brethren, joyful standOn the borders of your land;Christ, your Father’s holy Son,Bids you undismayed go on.

Lord, submissive we would go,Gladly leaving all below;Only Thou our Leader be,And we still will follow Thee.
