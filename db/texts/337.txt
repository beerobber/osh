To Thy pastures fair and large,Heav'nly Shepherd, lead Thy charge;And my couch with tend'rest care,'Midst the springing grass prepare,'Midst the springing grass prepare.

When I faint with summer's heat,Thou shalt guide my weary feetTo the streams that, still and slow,Thru the verdant meadows flow,Thru the verdant meadows flow.

Constant to my latest end,Thou my footsteps shall attend;And shalt bid Thy hallowed domeYield me an eternal home,Yield me an eternal home.
Safe the dreary vale I treadBy the shades of death o'erspread,With Thy rod and staff supplied,This my guard, and that my guide,This my guard, and that my guide.
