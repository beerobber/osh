’Twixt Jesus and the chosen race Subsists a bond of sov’reign grace, That hell, with its infernal train, Shall ne’er dissolve, or rend in twain. 

This sacred bond shall never break, Though earth should to her center shake; Rest, doubting saint, assured of this, For God has pledged His holiness. 

He swore but once, the deed was done; ’Twas settled by the great Three One; Christ was appointed to redeem All that the Father loved in Him. 

Hail sacred union, firm and strong! How great the grace, how sweet the song! That worms of earth should ever be One with incarnate dei ty! 

One in the tomb, one when He rose, One when He triumphed o’er His foes, One when in heav’n He took His seat; While seraphs sung all hell’s defeat. 

This sacred tie forbids their fears, For all He is, or has is theirs; With Him their Head, they stand or fall, Their life, their surety, and their all.
