Come, Thou Almighty King, Help us Thy name to sing,Help us to praise; Father, allglorious, O’er all victorious; Come and reign over us, Ancient of Days.

Come, Thou Incarnate Word, Gird on Thy mighty sword, Our prayer attend; Come and Thy people bless, And give Thyword success; Spirit of holiness, On us descend.

Come, Holy Comforter, Thy sacred witness bearIn this glad hour; Thou who almighty art, Now rule inev’ry heart, And ne’er from us depart, Spirit of pow’r.

To the great One in Three Eternal praises beHence evermore; His sov’reign majesty May we inglory see, And to eternity Love and adore. 





Hungry, and faint, and poor,Behold us, Lord, again,Assembled at Thy mercy’s door,Thy bounty to obtain.

Thy word invites us nigh,Or we must starve indeed;For we no money have to buy,No righteousness to plead.

The food our spirits want,Thy hand alone can give;O hear the pray’r of faith and grantThat we may eat and live.







A throne of grace! Then let us goAnd offer up our prayer;A gracious God will mercy showTo all that worship there.

A throne of grace: O at that throneOur knees have often bent;And God has show’red His blessings downAs often as we went.

A throne of grace! Rejoice, ye saints,That throne is open still;To God unbosom your complaints,And then inquire His will.

A throne of grace we yet shall need,Long as we draw our breath;A Savior, too, to intercede,Till we are changed by death.

The throne of glory then shall glowWith beams from Jesus’ face;And we no longer want shall know,Nor need a throne of grace.
