Jesus, grant us all a blessing,Send it down, Lord, from above;

May we all go home aprayingAnd rejoicing in Thy love.

Jesus, pardon all our folliesWhile together we have been;

Make us humble, make us holy,Cleanse us all from ev’ry sin!

May this blessing, Lord, go with us,To each one’s respective home;

And the presence of our JesusRest upon us, ev’ry one.



Farewell, brethren, farewell, sisters,Till we all shall meet again;

D.C.–Farewell, brethren, farewell, sisters,Till we all shall meet again.
