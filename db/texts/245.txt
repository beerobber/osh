Faith can create no truth we know, But trusts a truth revealed; It apprehends our Lord and shows A pardon full and sealed. 

Faith cannot justify from death Nor justify to life; In Christ's obedience and His blood It sees His spotless life. 

Faith never wrought a garment out To clothe a guilty soul; It views the garment wrought by Christ And claims that garment whole. 

Thus faith creates no truth at all, But finds it in the Lord; The word declares the truth in Him, And faith approves the word.
