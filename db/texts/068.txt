Jesus, and shall it ever be,A mortal man ashamed of Thee!Ashamed of Thee, whom angels praise,Whose glory shines thru endless days.

Ashamed of Jesus! sooner farLet ev’ning blush to own a star;He sheds the beams of light divineO’er this benighted soul of mine.

Ashamed of Jesus! just as soonLet midnight be ashamed of noon;’Tis midnight with my soul till He,Bright Morning Star, bids darkness flee.

Ashamed of Jesus! that dear FriendOn whom my hopes of heav’n depend!No! when I blush, be this my shame,That I no more revere His name.
