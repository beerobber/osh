To Him who did salvation bring, Wake ev'ry tuneful pow'r and sing A song of sweetest praise, A song of sweetest praise; His grace diffuses as the rainsCrown nature's flow'ry hills and plains And spread a thousand ways,And spread a thousand ways.

We feel redemption drawing near;We soon in glory shall appear,And be forever blessed,And be forever blessed;His promise never can delay;Our Jesus on th' appointed dayWill give His people rest,Will give His people rest.
By faith we view Him coming down,With angels hov'ring all around;He smiles upon His saints,He smiles upon His saints;He cries aloud in melting strains,"I come to save you from your pains,And end your sore complaints,And end your sore complaints."

The smiling millions rise and sing,"All glory, glory to our King!The Grand Assize is come,The Grand Assize is come!"You everlasting doors, fly wide,The church is glor'ous as a bride,And Jesus takes her home,And Jesus takes her home.
