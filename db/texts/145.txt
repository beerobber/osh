Ah! wretched, vile, ungrateful heart, That can from Jesus thus depart; Thus fond of trifles, vainly rove, Forgetful of a Saviour's love. In vain, I charge my thoughts to stay, And chide each vanity away; In vain, alas! resolve to bind This wand'ring heart, this rebel mind. 

Thru all resolves how soon it flies, And mocks the weak, the slender ties! There's nought beneath a pow'r divine That can this roving heart confine. O let thy love, with sweet control, Bind all the passions of my soul; Bid ev'ry vanity depart, And dwell forever in my heart.
