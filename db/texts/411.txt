Bliss comes thru sore temptationAnd conflicts by the way;Remember blessed Jesus,And don't forget to pray,I'm on my way to Canaan,I'm on my way to Canaan,I'm on my way to Canaan,To the new Jerusalem.

The suff'ring church of JesusWas chosen and redeemed;Contained in that great numberSome martyrs can be seen,How sad was their conditionTill Jesus made them whole;He is the good  PhysicianThat cures the sin-sick soul.

O, grave, where is thy vict'ry?O, death, where is thy sting?We're going home to glory,There we'll forever sing,Farewell to all our kindredIn this sad world below;We're going home to JesusTo praise Him evermore.
