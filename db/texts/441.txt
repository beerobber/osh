Master, the tempest is raging!The billows are tossing high!The sky is o'ershadowed with blackness,No shelter or help is nigh;Carest thou not that we perish?How canst thou lie asleep,When each moment so madly is threat'ning A grave in the angry deep?

Master, with anguish of spiritI bow in my grief today!The depths of my sad heart are troubled,O waken and save, I pray;Torrents of sin and of anguishSweep o'er my sinking soul;And I perish! I perish! dear Master,O hasten and take control.

Master, the terror is over,The elements sweetly rest;Earth's sun in the calm lake is mirrored,And heaven's within my breast;Linger, O blessed Redeemer!Leave me alone no more;And with joy I shall make the blest harbor,And rest on the blissful shore.

The winds and the waves shall obey Thy will, Peace, be still!Whether the wrath of the storm-tossed sea,Or demons, or men, or whatever it be,No waters can swallow the ship where liesThe Master of ocean, and earth, and skies;They all shall sweetly obey Thy will, Peace, be still! peace, be still!They all shall sweetly obey Thy will;Peace, peace, be still!

Peace, be still, peace, be still!
