Oh, beautiful Star of Bethlehem, shining afar thru shadows dim,Giving a light for those who long have gone;And guiding the wise men on their way unto the place where Jesus lay,

Oh, beautiful Star, the hope of light, guiding the pilgrim thru the night,Over the mountain till the break of dawn;And into the light of perfect day it will give out a lovely ray,Beautiful Star of Bethlehem, shine on.Ê

Oh, beautiful Star, the hope of rest, for the redeemed, the good and blest,Yonder in glory when the crown is won;For Jesus is now that Star divine, brighter and brighter He will shine,


Oh, beautiful Star of Bethlehem, Shine upon us until the glory dawn;

Oh, give us Thy light to light the way into the land of perfect day,Beautiful Star of Bethlehem, shine on.

Beautiful, beautiful Star, Star of Bethlehem, glory dawn;
