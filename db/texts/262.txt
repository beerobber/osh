Dear child of God, dost thou not know, That thou shalt reap what thou dost sow?If to thy flesh thou sow'st thy fields, Corruption is the fruit that yields.

And if thou sparingly shalt sow, Then sparingly thy fruit shall grow;But if abundant seeds are sown, Abundant fruit shall then be grown.

May Jesus help thee sow good seed, In all thy tho'ts and words and deeds;And thou shalt find in harvest days, It shall return in num'rous ways.
