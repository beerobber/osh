A throne of grace! Then let us goAnd offer up our prayer;A gracious God will mercy showTo all that worship there.

A throne of grace: O at that throneOur knees have often bent;And God has show’red His blessings downAs often as we went.

A throne of grace! Rejoice, ye saints,That throne is open still;To God unbosom your complaints,And then inquire His will.

A throne of grace we yet shall need,Long as we draw our breath;A Savior, too, to intercede,Till we are changed by death.

The throne of glory then shall glowWith beams from Jesus’ face;And we no longer want shall know,Nor need a throne of grace.
