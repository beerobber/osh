Joy to the world! the Lord is come;Let earth receive her King;Let ev'ry heart prepare Him room,And heav'n and nature sing,And heav'n and nature sing,And heav'n, and heav'n and nature sing.

Joy to the earth! the Savior reigns;Let men their songs employ;While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plainsRepeat the sounding joy,Repeat the sounding joy,Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.

He rules the world with truth and grace,And makes the nations proveThe glories of His righteousness,And wonders of His love,And wonders of His love,And wonders, wonders of His love.



















And heav'n and nature sing, And heav'n and nature And sing, heav'n and nature sing. 

Repeat the sounding joy, Repeat the sounding Rejoy, peat the sounding joy. 

And wonders of His love, And wonders of His And love, wonders of His love.
