A glor’ous rest is promised, a home forever bright;Where clouds shall never gather, a home where is no night.

There palms and crowns await us, and robes of spotless white;But best of all, a heaven, a home where is no night.

When loosed from earthly trials, the spirit takes its flight;To dwell in realms of glory, where Jesus is the light.







No night, no night,But eternal day is giv’n;No night, no night,There will be no night in heav’n.

No night, no night, No night, no night,
