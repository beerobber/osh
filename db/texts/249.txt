I have heard of a land on the far away strand,’Tis a beautiful home of the soul;Built by Jesus on high, there we never shall die,’Tis a land where we’ll never grow old.

When our work here is done, and the lifecrown is won,And our troubles and trials are o’er,All our sorrow will end, and our voices will blendWith the loved ones who’ve gone on before.







Never grow old,  never grow old,In a land where we’ll never grow old;Never grow old,  never grow old,In a land where we’ll never grow old. 

where we’ll where we’ll
