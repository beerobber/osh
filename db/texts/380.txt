The hand that wrought salvation true, My strength it daily doth renew. True Wisdom saved my soul from hell; What providence now I must tell!

As Joseph’s brethren evil thought, This cruel world her threats have wrought; They evil thought; Thou meant to good. Thy providence reigns as it should.

In prison Paul the gospel preached; To Caesar’s palace it did reach. Tho’ man’s vile purposes shall fail, Thy hand, oh Lord, fore’er prevails.

An hedge about me Thou hast placed To hold and harbor by Thy grace. Oh, build that wall around my heart; Let providence not soon depart.

Our gracious Lord did wonders make, Poor wretched sinners’ souls did save, And still delivers as we walk; What providence and glories all!

Our God, eternal, He doth reign; On earth we strive to know His ways. His purposes on earth shall stand; What gracious providence  to man!

The hand that wrought salvation true, My strength it daily doth renew. True Wisdom saved my soul from hell; What providence now I must tell!
