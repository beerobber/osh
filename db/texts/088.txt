People of the living God,I have sought the world around,Paths of sin and sorrow trod,Peace and comfort nowhere found;Now to you my spirit turns,Turns a fugitive unblest;Brethren, where your altar burns,Oh, receive me into rest.
Lonely I no longer roam,Like the cloud, the wind, the wave,Where you dwell will be my home,Where you die shall be my grave;Mine the God whom you adore,Your Redeemer shall be mine;Earth can fill my soul no more,Ev'ry idol I resign.

Tell me not of gain or loss,Ease, enjoyment, pomp, or pow'r,Welcome poverty and cross,Shame, reproach, affliction's hour;ÒFollow Me,Ó I know Thy voice,Jesus, Lord, Thy steps I see;Now I take this yoke by choice,Light Thy burden now to me.
