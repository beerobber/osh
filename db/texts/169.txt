How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord,Is laid for your faith in His excellent word!What more can He say than to you He hath said,You who unto Jesus for refuge have fled?

In ev'ry condition, in sickness, in health,In poverty's vale, or abounding in wealth,At home, and abroad, on the land, on the sea,"As thy days may demand, shall thy strength ever be."

ÒFear not, I am with thee; O be not dismayed,For I am thy God, and will still give thee aid;I'll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand,ÊUpheld by my righteous, omnipotent hand.

"When thru the deep waters I call thee to go,The rivers of woe shall not thee overflow;For I will be with thee, thy troubles to bless,And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress.

"When thru fiery trials thy pathway shall lie,My grace, allsufficient, shall be thy supply;The flame shall not hurt thee; I only designThy dross to consume, and thy gold to refine.

"E'en down to old age, all my people shall proveMy sov'reign, eternal, unchangeable love;And when hoary hairs shall their temples adorn,Like lambs they shall still in my bosom be borne.

 "The soul that on Jesus still leans for reposeI will not, I will not desert to his foes;That soul, tho' all hell should endeavor to shake,I'll never, no never, no never forsake!"
