When the way seems dark and long, as I pass amid the throng,Hold to my hand, dear Lord, I pray;Give me grace to shout and shine, ever in the light divine,Lord, lead me on from day to day.

In this world of doubt and gloom, when hope’s flowers fail to bloom,Hold to my hand, dear Lord, I pray;I have put my faith in Thee, till the homeland I shall see,Lord, lead me on from day to day.

When old age is stealing on, and my strength is almost gone,Hold to my hand, dear Lord, I pray;Surely Thou wilt ne’er forsake, till in heaven I awake,Lord, lead me on from day to day.







Lord, lead me on from day to day.I want to walk the holy way;Tho friends forsake me all alone,I ask Thee, Lord, to lead me on. to lead me on. 

Lord, lead me on from day to day.I want to walk the holy way;Tho friends forsake me all alone,I ask Thee, Lord, to lead me on.









 Lord, lead me on, 

Hold to my hand, dear Lord, I pray; from day to day.
