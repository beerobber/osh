I've seen the lightning flashing,And heard the thunder roll,I've felt sin's breakers dashing,Trying to conquer my soul;
I've heard the voice of Jesus,ÊTelling me still to fight on,He promised never to leave me,Never to leave me alone.
The world's fierce winds are blowing,Temptations sharp and keen,I feel a peace in knowing,My Savior stands between;
He stands to shield me from dangerWhen earthly friends are gone;He promised never to leave me,Never to leave me alone.
When in affliction's valley,I'm treading the road of care,My Savior helps me to carryMy cross when heavy to bear;
My feet entangled with briars,Ready to cast me down,My Savior whispers His promise: "INever will leave thee alone."
He died for me on the mountain,For me they pierced His side,For me He opened that fountain,The crimson, cleansing tide;
For me He's waiting in glory,Seated upon His throne;He promised never to leave me,Never to leave me alone.


No, never alone,No, never alone,He promised never to leave me,Never to leave me alone.
