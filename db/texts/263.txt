I would see Jesus when the flow’rs Of joy adorn my way; When sun shine and when hope surrounds My path from day to day. When friends I cherish most are near, And hearts encircle mine, Then, Father, would I turn from all, To lean alone on Thine.

To those who know the Lord, I speak — Is my Beloved near? The Bridegroom of my soul I seek  — O, when will He appear? Though once a man of grief and shame, Yet now He fills a throne, And bears the greatest, sweetest name That earth or heav’n has known.

Grace flies before and love attends His steps where’er He He goes, Though none can see Him but His friends, And they were once His foes. He speaks — obedient to His call Our warm affections move; Did He but shine alike on all, Then all alike would love.

Then love in ev’ry heart would reign,  And war would cease to roar, And cruel and bloodthirsty men Would thirst for blood no more. Such Jesus is, and such His grace, O, may He shine on you; And tell Him when you see His face, I long to see Him, too.
