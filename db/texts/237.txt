Lord, I believe; Thy pow’r I own,Thy Word I would obey;I wander comfortless and loneWhen from Thy truth I stray.

Lord, I believe; but gloomy fearsSometimes bedim my sight;I look to Thee with pray’rs and tears,And cry for strength and light.

Lord, I believe; but oft I know,My faith is cold and weak;My weakness strengthen, and bestowThe confidence I seek.

Yes, I believe; and only ThouCanst give my soul relief;Lord, to Thy truth my spirit bow; “Help Thou my unbelief!”
