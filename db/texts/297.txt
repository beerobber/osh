I love my Savior, God,Because He first loved me;Because He shed His precious bloodTo set my spirit free.

’Twas love my bosom felt,And made me wipe mine eyes,When low before His throne I kneltTo pour my feeble cries.

Touched by His dying love,I melted into grief,Swift on the wings of love He movedAnd bro’t me sweet relief.

With my whole heart I loveThe God that loved and bled;Who left the shining realms aboveAnd suffered in my stead.

Who can forbear to loveA God so good and kind?Sure He is worthy to be lovedBy me and all mankind.
