Now the day is over, Night is drawing nigh,Shadows of the ev’ning Steal across the sky.

Jesus, give the weary Calm and sweet repose;With Thy tend’rest blessing May our eyelids close.

When the morning wakens, Then may I arisePure and fresh and sinless In Thy holy eyes. 



















ev’ning Steal across the sky. 

blessing May our eyelids close.

sinless In Thy holy eyes.
