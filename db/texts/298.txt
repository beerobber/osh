Oh, for a faith that will not fail,When storm clouds gather round;When Satan threatens to prevail,And friends cannot be found.

Lord, give me faith, anointing grace,That when the test shall come,I may not falter in this race,While on my journey home.

Oh, for a faith that will abide,The dark and cloudy day,When friends unite with foes to ride,And with them turn away.

Give me this faith, dear Lord, I pray,While on the battle line,That I may never from Thee stray,Nor let my zeal decline.
