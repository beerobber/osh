Hail, sweetest, dearest tie that bindsOur glowing hearts in one;Hail, sacred hope that tunes our mindsTo harmony divine.It is the hope, the blissful hope,ÊWhich Jesus' grace has giv'n,The hope, when days and years are past,We all shall meet in heav'n.

What tho' the northern wintry blastShall howl around our cot,What tho' beneath an eastern sunBe cast our distant lot.Yet still we share the blissful hope,Which Jesus' grace has giv'n,The hope, when days and years are past,We all shall meet in heav'n.

From Burma's shore, from Afric's strand,From India's burning plain,From Europe, from Columbia's land,We hope to meet again.It is the hope, the blissful hope,Which Jesus' grace has giv'n,The hope, when days and years are past,We all shall meet in heav'n.

No lingr'ing look, no parting sigh,ÊOur future meeting knows;There friendship beams from ev'ry eye,And love immortal glows.O sacred hope, O blissful hope,Which Jesus' grace has giv'n,The hope, when days and years are past,We all shall meet in heav'n.
