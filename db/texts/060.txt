“Man of Sorrows,” what a nameFor the Son of God who cameRuined sinners to reclaim,Hallelujah, what a Savior!

Bearing shame and scoffing rude,In my place condemned he stood;Sealed my pardon with His blood,Hallelujah, what a Savior!

Guilty, vile, and helpless we: Spotless Lamb of God was He; “Full atonement!” can it be? 

Lifted up was He to die,“It is finished,” was His cry;Now in Heav’n exalted high:Hallelujah, what a Savior!

When He comes, our glor’ous King,All His ransomed home to bring,Then anew this song we’ll sing:Hallelujah, what a Savior!
