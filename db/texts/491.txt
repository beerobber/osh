When I can read my title clear To mansions in the skies,

Should earth against my soul engage,And fi’ry darts be hurled,

There shall I bathe my weary soulIn seas of heav’nly rest,



















I’ll bid farewell, I’ll bid farewell,I’ll bid farewell to ev’ry fear,And wipe my weeping eyes.

Then I can smile, Then I can smile,Then I can smile at Satan’s rage,And face a frowning world. 

And not a wave, And not a wave,And not a wave of trouble rollAcross my peaceful breast. 

I’ll bid farewell, I’ll bid farewell,I’ll bid farewell to ev’ry fear,And wipe my weeping eyes.

Then I can smile at Satan’s rage,

And not a wave of trouble roll
