When I can read my title clear To mansions in the skies,I'll bid farewell, I'll bid farewell,I'll bid farewell to ev'ry fear,And wipe my weeping eyes.

Should earth against my soul engage,And fi'ry darts be hurled,Then I can smile, Then I can smile,Then I can smile at Satan's rage,And face a frowning world. 

There shall I bathe my weary soulIn seas of heav'nly rest,
And not a wave, And not a wave,And not a wave of trouble rollAcross my peaceful breast.
