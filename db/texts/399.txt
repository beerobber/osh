Sometimes I feel discouraged and think my life in vain,I'm tempted then to murmur and of my lot complain;But when I think of Jesus and all He's done for me,Then I cry, "O Rock of Ages, hide Thou me."

Sometimes it seems I dare not go one step farther on,And from my heart all courage has disappeared and gone,But I remember Jesus and all His love for me,Then I cry, "O Rock of Ages, hide Thou me."

O what a Friend is Jesus, sure Anchor for my soul!So tender, true, and gracious, I'm safe in His control;My Help in time of danger, my strong Defense is He,"O Thou blessed Rock of Ages, hide Thou me."


O Rock of Ages, hide Thou me,No other refuge have I but Thee!When life's dark vale I wander, far, far from Thee,Then I cry, "O Rock of Ages, hide Thou me!"
