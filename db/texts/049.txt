Hallelujah, praise Jehovah! From the heavens praise His name;Praise Jehovah in the highest; All His angels praise proclaim.All His hosts together praise Him, Sun and moon and stars on high;Praise Him, O ye heav’n of heavens, And ye floods above the sky.

Let them praises give Jehovah! They were made at His command;Them forever He established: His decree shall ever stand.From the earth, O praise Jehovah, All ye floods, ye dragons all,Fire and hail and snow and vapors, Stormy winds that hear him call. 

All ye fruitful trees and cedars, All ye hills and mountains high,Creeping things and beasts and cattle, Birds that in the heavens fly,Kings of earth, and all ye people, Princes great, earth’s judges all;Praise His name, young men and maidens, Aged men and children small.







Let them praises give Jehovah, For His name alone is high,And His glory is exalted, And His glory is exalted, And His glory is exaltedFar above the earth and sky. 

Let them praises give Jehovah, And His glory is exalted, And His glory is exalted, And His glory is exalted
