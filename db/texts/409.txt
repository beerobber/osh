Mixtures of joy and sorrowI daily do pass thru;Sometimes I'm in the valley,And sinking down with woe;Sometimes I am exalted,On eagle's wings I fly;I rise above my troubles,And hope to reach the sky.Sometimes I'm full of doubting,And think I have no grace;Sometimes I'm full of praising,When Christ reveals His face;Sometimes my hope's so little,I think I'll throw it by;Sometimes it seems sufficient,If I were called to die.

Sometimes I shun the Christian,Lest he should talk to me;Sometimes he is the neighborI long the most to see;Sometimes we meet together,The season's dry and dull;Sometimes we find a blessing;With joy it fills my soul.

Sometimes I travel mourningDown Babel's ancient stream;Sometimes my Lord's religionAppears my only theme;Sometimes when I am praying,It seems almost a task;Sometimes receive a blessing,The greatest I can ask.
