No more, my God! I boast no moreOf all the duties I have done;I quit the hopes I held before,To trust the merits of Thy Son.

Now for the love I bear His name,What was my gain I count my loss,My former pride I call my shame,And nail my glory to His cross.

Yes, and I must and will esteemAll things but loss for Jesus' sake;Oh! may my soul be found in Him,And of His righteousness partake.

The best obedience of my handsDares not appear before Thy throne,But faith can answer Thy demandsBy pleading what my Lord has done.
