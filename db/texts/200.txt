O, when shall I see Jesus, And reign with Him above? And shall hear the trumpet sound in that morning. And from the flowing fountain Drink everlasting love? And shall hear the trumpet sound in that morning. 

When shall I be delivered From this vain world of sin? And shall hear the trumpet sound in that morning. And with my blessed Jesus Drink endless pleasures in? And shall hear the trumpet sound  in that morning. 

Our eyes shall then with rapture The Saviour's face behold; And  shall hear the trumpet sound in that morning. Our feet, no more diverted, Shall walk the streets of gold; And shall hear the trumpet sound in that morning. 

Our ears shall hear with transport The hosts celestial sing; And shall hear the trumpet sound in that morning. Our tongues shall chant the glories Of our immortal King. We shall hear the trumpet sound in that morning.





Shout, O  glory! for I shall mount above the skies, When I hear the trumpet sound in that morning.
