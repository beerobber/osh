When my soul is singing in that promised land above,ÊI'll be satisfied;Praising Christ the Savior for redeeming grace and love,ÊI'll be satisfied.

Living in a city where the soul shall never die,ÊI'll be satisfied;There to meet with loved ones, nevermore to say goodbye,ÊI'll be satisfied.

When I meet the ransomed over on the golden shore,ÊI'll be satisfied;There I'll join the angels singing praises evermore,ÊI'll be satisfied.







I'll be satisfied,ÊI'll be satisfied;

When my soul is resting in the presence of the Lord,ÊI'll be satisfied.Ê

satisfied, satisfied;
