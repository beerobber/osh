When my soul is singing in that promised land above,ÊIÕll be satisfied;Praising Christ the Savior for redeeming grace and love,ÊIÕll be satisfied.

Living in a city where the soul shall never die,ÊIÕll be satisfied;There to meet with loved ones, nevermore to say goodbye,ÊIÕll be satisfied.

When I meet the ransomed over on the golden shore,ÊIÕll be satisfied;There IÕll join the angels singing praises evermore,ÊIÕll be satisfied.







IÕll be satisfied,ÊIÕll be satisfied;

D.S.ÐWhen my soul is resting in the presence of the Lord,ÊIÕll be satisfied.Ê

satisfied, satisfied;
