Do not I love Thee, O my Lord?Behold my heart and see;And turn each cursed idol outThat dares to rival Thee!

Do not I love Thee from my heart?Then let me nothing love;Dead be my heart to ev'ry joyWhich Thou dost not approve.

Is not Thy name melod'ous stillTo mine attentive ear?Does not each pulse with pleasure beatMy Savior's voice to hear?

Hast Thou a lamb in all Thy flockI would disdain to feed?Hast Thou a foe before whose faceI fear Thy cause to plead?

Thou know'st I love Thee, dearest Lord,But, oh! I long to soarFar from the sphere of mortal joys,That I may love Thee more.
