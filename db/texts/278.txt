Once more we come before our God,Once more His blessings ask;O may not duty seem a load,ÊNor worship prove a task.

Father, Thy quick'ning Spirit sendFrom heav'n in Jesus' name;To make our waiting minds attend,And put our souls in frame.

May we receive the word we hear, Each in an honest heart,And keep the precious treasure there, And never with it part.

To seek Thee, all our hearts dispose,To each Thy blessings suit;And let the seed Thy servant sowsProduce abundant fruit.
