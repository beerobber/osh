Love sent my Savior to die in my stead,Why should He love me so?Meekly to Calvary's cross He was led,Why should He love me so?

Nails pierced His hands and His feet for my sins,Why should He love me so?He suffered sore my salvation to win,Why should He love me so?

O, how He agonized there in my place,Why should He love me so?Nothing withholding my sins to efface;Why should He love me so?







Why should He love me so?Why should He love me so?Why should my Savior to Calvary go?Why should He love me so?

 love me so? love me so?
