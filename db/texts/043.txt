Wonderful Jesus! glorious friend!He will be with me unto the end,Cheering, upholding, keeping me strong,Fearless and loyal, shielding from wrong.

Wonderful Jesus! showing the way,Into the blessed kingdom of day,Guiding my footsteps, holding control,Making me happy, keeping me whole.

Wonderful Jesus! all thru the nightHe will enfold me, giving me light;Then when the morning breaks on the shore,This He will whisper, ÒMine evermore.Ó







Wonderful Jesus! marvelous King!Ever His praise my spirit shall sing;When I behold His glorified face,How I shall praise His wonderful grace!
