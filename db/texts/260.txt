From whence this fear and unbelief? Hath not the Father put to grief His spotless Son for me? And will the righteous judge of men Condemn me for that debt of sin Which, Lord, was charged on Thee, was charged on Thee?

Complete atonement Thou hast made, And to the utmost farthing paid Whate’er Thy people owed; How then can wrath on me take place If sheltered in Thy righteousness, And sprinkled with Thy blood, yes with Thy blood? 

If Thou hast my discharge procured, And freely in my room endured The whole of wrath divine, Payment God cannot twice demand— First at my bleeding Surety’s hand, And then again at mine, again at mine.

Turn then, my soul, unto thy rest! The merits of thy great High Priest Have bought thy liberty; Trust in His efficacious blood, Nor fear thy banishment from God, Since Jesus died for thee, He died for thee!
