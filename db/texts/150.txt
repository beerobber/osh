O, Jesus, my Savior, I know Thou art mine; For Thee all the pleasures of sin I resign. Of objects most pleasing I love Thee the best; Without Thee I'm wretched, but with Thee I'm blest.

The Spirit first taught me to know I was blind, Then taught me the way of salvation to find; And when I was sinking in gloomy despair, Thy mercy relieved me and bid me not fear.

In vain I attempt to describe what I feel; The language of mortals or angels would fail; My Jesus is precious, my soul's in a flame; I'm raised to a rapture while praising His name.

I find Him in singing, I find Him in prayer; In sweet meditation He always is near; My constant companion, O may we ne'er part; All glory to Jesus, He dwells in my heart.

I love Thee, my Saviour, I love Thee my Lord, I love Thy dear people, Thy ways and Thy word; With tender emotion I love sinners, too, Since Jesus has died to redeem them from woe.

My Jesus is precious; I cannot forbear, Tho' sinners despise me, His love to declare; His love overwhelms me!  Had I wings I'd fly To praise Him in  mansions prepared in the sky.

Then millions of ages my soul would employ In praising my Jesus, my love and my joy Without interruption, when all the glad throng, With pleasures unceasing unite in the song.
