O help us, Lord! Each hour of need, Thy heav’nly succor give;Help us in tho’t and word and deed, Each hour on earth we live!O help us when our spirits bleed With contrite anguish sore;And when our hearts are cold and dead, O help us, Lord, the more!

O help us, thru the pray’r of faith, More firmly to believe;For still the more the servant hath, The more shall he receive.If strangers to Thy fold we call, Imploring at Thy feetThe crumbs that from Thy table fall, ’Tis all we dare entreat.

But be it, Lord of mercy, all, So Thou wilt grant but this;The crumbs that from Thy table fall Are light and life and bliss.O help us, Jesus, from on high; We know no help but Thee;O help us, so to live and die, As Thine in heav’n to be!
