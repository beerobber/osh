Savior, I come to Thee,On Thee I call,Thou art my hope and plea,Jesus, my all;Thou, Lord, my refuge art,Comfort Thou me,Heal Thou my aching heart,Thine would I be.

Savior, I come to Thee,ÊGive me, I pray,Thru Thy great love so free,Strength for each day;Thou knowest all my care,Jesus, my King,Knowest the grief I bear,To Thee I cling.

Savior, I come to Thee,Be Thou my Light,Upward my footsteps leadOut of the night;Into the heav'nly day,Bright with Thy love,Lead me, O Lord, I pray,Homeward above.
