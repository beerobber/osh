Now to the pow'r of God supremeBe everlasting honor giv'n;

He saves from hell (we bless His name),ÊHe calls our wand'ring feet to heav'n;Ê

Not for our duties or desserts,But of His own abounding grace,

He works salvation in our hearts,And forms a people for His praise;

'Twas His own own purpose that beganTo rescue rebels doomed to die;And I don't care to stay here long!

He gave us grace in Christ, His Son,Before He spread the starry sky.And I don't care to stay here long!

 Jesus the Lord appears at last,And makes His Father's counsels known;

 Declares the great transaction's past,And brings immortal blessings down.

 He dies! And in that dreadful nightDid all the  pow'rs of hell destroy;

 Rising, He bro't our heav'n to light,And took possession of the joy.

Right up yonder, Christians, away up yonder!O, yes, my Lord, for I don't care to stay here long.
