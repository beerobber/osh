Be still and know that I AM God, I made the earth you walk upon. No trial can come that I don't see, Be still and know I care for thee. 

Be still and know I AM the LORD, I loved you long before you were born. No height or depth can take you from me, 

Be still and know I AM the Light, Warmth for the day, comfort in the night. A lamp on the path I'll guide your feet, 

Be still and know I AM the Holy One For love of you I gave my Son To suffer death, now you are free 
All because I care for thee.
