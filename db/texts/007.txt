Brethren, we have met to worshipAnd adore the Lord our God;Will you pray with all your power,While we try to preach the word?All is vain unless the SpiritOf the Holy One come down;Let us pray that holy mannaMay be showered all around.

Look and see poor mourners ’round you,Fearing, trembling, as they go,Longing for a consolation,Will you comfort them, or no?Let us tell them of the Savior,Tell them that He will be found;Let us pray that holy mannaMay be showered all around.

Is there here a trembling jailor,Seeking peace and filled with fears?Is there here a weeping Mary,Pouring forth a flood of tears?Let us join our prayers to help them,Let our faith and love abound;Let us pray that holy mannaMay be showered all around.

Let us love our God supremely,Let us love each other, too;Let us love and pray for mournersTill their Savior they can view. Then we’ll love them still the better,Take them to our kind embrace,Journey with them on to glory,There to sing redeeming grace.
