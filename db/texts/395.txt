Come, all ye chosen saints of God,Whose souls are washed in Jesus’ blood,Hear what He says, His word is true,My grace sufficient is for you.I am your sure, almighty friendWho loving, loves you to the end;I will be near you, and will show,My grace sufficient is for you.

I know how num’rous are your foes,I know the ways which they oppose,I know their cunning malice, too,My grace sufficient is for you.Tho’ Satan tries your souls to snare,You’re still the objects of My care;You’re near my heart, I’ll bring you thru,My grace sufficient is for you.

Do you want proof of this, My love?Calv’ry survey, then heav’n above,See how the ransomed millions do,My grace sufficient is for you.I’ll guide you safely in the way,Thru life’s dark night to heav’n’s bright day;And there with wonder you shall vie,My grace sufficient is for you.
