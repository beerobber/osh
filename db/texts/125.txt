Jesus the God invites us here To this triumphal feast, 1.ÊAnd brings immortal blessings down For each redeemed guest. 

The Lord, how glorious is His face! How kind His smiles appear! 2.ÊAnd O, what melting words He says To ev'ry humble ear. 

"For you, the children of my love, It was for you I died; 3.ÊBehold my hands, behold my feet, And look into my side. 

"These are the wounds for you I bore, The tokens of my pains, 4.ÊWhen I came down to free your souls From misery and chains. 

"Justice unsheathed its fiery sword, And plunged it in my heart; 5.ÊInfinite pangs for you I bore, And most tormenting smart. 

"When hell and all its spiteful pow'rs Stood dreadful in my way, 6.ÊTo rescue those dear lives of yours, I gave my own away. 

 "But while I bled and groaned and died, I ruined Satan's throne; 7.ÊHigh on the cross I hung, and spied The monster tumbling down."

Victorious God! what can we pay For favors so divine? 8.ÊWe would devote our hearts away, To be forever Thine.
