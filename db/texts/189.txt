A story most lovely I'll tell of Jesus, O wondrous surprise! He suffered to save us from hell, That sinners, wile sinners might rise; He left His exalted abode, When man by transgressions was lost, Fulfilling the law of our God, He shed forth His blood as the cost. 

O, did my dear Jesus thus bleed, And pity His chosen,Ê lost race?From whence did such mercies proceed, Such boundless compassion and grace?ÊHis body bore anguish and pain, His Spirit 'most sunk with the load;ÊA short time before He was slain His sweat was as great drops of blood.

O, was it for crimes I have done, The Savior was hailed with a kiss By Judas, the traitor, alone? Was ever compassion like this? They made Him a crown out of thorns, They smote Him and did Him abuse, They clothed Him with crimson and scorn, And hailed Him the King of the Jews. 

They loaded the Lamb with the cross, And drove Him up Calvary's hill; He hung with the nails thru His hands; All nature looks solemn and still; The temple veil bursted in twain, The sun then refused to shine, He groaned out His last, and He died, This lovely Redeemer of mine. 

 He fought the hard battle, and won The vict'ry, and gave it most free; O, Christians look upward and run; Our Savior before us we see; When He in the clouds shall appear, To call us from this earthly sod, We'll sing of salvation on high, And rest with our glorious God.
