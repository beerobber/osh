Does Jesus care when my heart is painedToo deeply for mirth or song,As the burdens press,And the cares distress,And the way grows weary and long?

Does Jesus care when my way is darkWith a nameless dread and fear?As the daylight fadesInto deep night shades,Does He care enough to be near?

Does Jesus care when I’ve tried and failedTo resist some temptation strong,When for my deep griefThere is no relief,Tho’ my tears flow all the night long?

Does Jesus care when I’ve said, “goodbye,”To the dearest on earth to me,And my sad heart achesTill it nearly breaks,Is it aught to Him, does He see?





Oh, yes, He cares,I know He cares,His heart is touched with my grief;When the days are weary,The long night dreary,I know my Savior cares.

He cares.
