Have faith in God when your pathway is lonely,He sees and knows all the way you have trod;Never alone are the least of His children,Have faith in God, have faith in God.

Have faith in God when your prayers are unanswered,Your earnest plea He will never forget;Wait on the Lord, trust His word and be patient,Have faith in God, He'll answer yet.

Have faith in God in your pain and your sorrow,His heart is touched with your grief and despair;Cast all your cares and your burdens upon Him,And leave them there, oh, leave them there.

Have faith in God tho all else fail about you;Have faith in God, He provides for His own;He cannot fail tho all kingdoms shall perish,He rules, He reigns upon His throne.





Have faith in God, He's on His throne,Have faith in God, He watches o'er His own;He cannot fail; He must prevail,Have faith in God, have faith in God.
