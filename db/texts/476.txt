As I travel thru this pilgrim landThere is a Friend who walks with me,Leads me safely thru the sinking sand,It is the Christ of Calvary;This would be my pray’r, dear Lord, each day,To help me do the best I can,For I need Thy light to guide me day and night,Blessed Jesus, hold my hand.

Let me travel in the light divineThat I may see the blessed way;Keep me that I may be wholly ThineAnd sing redemption’s song some day;I will be a soldier brave and trueAnd ever firmly take a stand,As I onward go and daily meet the foe,Blessed Jesus, hold my hand.









Blessed Jesus, hold my hand,Yes, I need Thee ev’ry hour,Thru this land, this pilgrim landBy Thy saving pow’r;Hear my plea, my feeble plea,Lord, dear Lord, look down on me,When I kneel in pray’r,Blessed Jesus, hold my hand.

Jesus, hold my hand, I need Thee ev’ry hour, Thru this pilgrim land Protect me by Thy pow’r; Hear my feeble plea, O Lord, look down on me, When I kneel in pray’r I hope to meet you there,
