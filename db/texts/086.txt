O sir, we would see Jesus,The blessed Prince of Love,He only can relieve us,And all our griefs remove.O tell us, as a preacher,Where Jesus Christ doth dwell,Describe His charming feature,His glowing beauties tell.

O sir, we would see Jesus,The sinner’s constant Friend,We know He won’t deceive us,But love us to the end.His blessed word assures us His hidden ones shall stand;His mighty arm secures usFrom all the hostile band.

O sir, we would see Jesus,The glor’ous King of Grace;A sight of Him would ease us,And fill our souls with peace.We would behold His beautyAnd run into His arms,And learn the Christian’s dutyAmidst those blessed charms.

O sir, we would see Jesus,As Prophet, Priest, and King.We hope He will receive us,Tho’ we are poor and mean;For in the Holy ScripturesThis sacred truth we find:He saves such wretched creaturesOf meek and lowly mind.
