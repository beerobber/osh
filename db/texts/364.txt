The Lord my precious Shepherd is, I am His little sheep;He leads me to His pastures green,Beside still waters deep;In righteous paths He leadeth me,Lest I should go astray,Restores my soul, and makes me glad;I praise Him day by day.

Tho’ thru the shades of death I walkThe valleys dark and drear,His rod and staff, they comfort me,For He is always near;My head with oil He does anoint,My cup runs o’er with joy;The feast my Lord prepares for meMy foes cannot destroy.

Goodness and mercy follow me,Their joys I cannot tell;They comfort me and give me hopeThat in His house I’ll dwell;I want to praise Him while I liveBecause He loved me so,And rising to that glory world,A perfect praise I’ll know.
