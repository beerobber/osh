In this world we shall have tribulation; The words of the Savior are true, But look to the skies weary Christian, Redemption draws nigh unto you. 

Do you long to be freed from your prison? Like a bird from a cage you will fly; One word from the Savior descending, You’ll be changed in the blink of an eye. 

Are you worn down from racing so madly; Pursued by the beasts of this world? And Satan himself seeks to have you, See the banner of God’s love unfurl. 

Is your righteous soul vexed in you daily When it seems that the wicked will win? They’ll call for the rocks to fall on them When they see the Avenger descend. 

Don’t fear what you face now my brother, For no foe will stand in that day. Clothed in a vesture of crimson, On His wings He will bear us away! 

With a shout and the voice of th’ archangel, The dead in Christ first shall ascend, And all those alive and remaining, Shall rise up in the air to meet Him. 

Look up to the skies, weary Christian, Lift up your sorrowfilled eyes. He cometh with clouds in great glory. Look up; your redemption draws nigh, Look up; your redemption draws nigh. 

Look up, Oh, look up to the skies skies, weary Christian, Lift up, O, lift up your sorrowfilled eyes. He cometh with, cometh with clouds in great glory. Look
