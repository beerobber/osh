The thief hung condemned to die on the cruel tree; He lived a life of crime and sin, now ending bitterly; At first he mocked and cursed the Christ, 'til the Spirit changed his heart; What could have caused the Lord to leave on such a man His mark? 

The man bent on death and hurt to the church of God,He held the letters in his hand and would have killed them all,But Christ shone forth into his life and struck him on that road.The chief of sinners saved by grace is now in Christ's abode.

From depths of unsearchable stores of sov'reign grace To boundless heights, the greatest scenes of mercy e'er displayed; Here in this life, we only catch a glimpse of Him by faith. Some day we all will understand, we'll see Him face to face. 



Oh the depth of the riches of the wisdom of God!How unsearchable His judgments and His ways past finding out!For who hath known the mind of God or tried to counsel Him?For of Him, thru Him, and to Him be the glory Amen!
