I know that I cannot pray just like old Daniel,I cannot preach like the great apostle Paul;   But I know I love my Lord for all His favors,For He died for me to save me from the fall.Let me feel my Savior near when I am dying,Let me feel His precious arms around me tight;While I'm crossing Jordan's stream, there'll be no sighing,For on that shore my blessed Lord will be the light.

I love to hear the gospel preached while here I'm living,I'm made to feel upon the mountain top so high;While in this valley old Satan is deceiving,Then I fear the time to come for me to die.There'll be shouting on the hills of shining gloryWhen I leave this world of sin and toil and strife,I will be with Christ, my Lord, to tell the storyOf His gift to me for my eternal life.

I'm waiting now till I can climb up Zion's mountain,I'm list'ning now to hear that final trumpet sound;I'll see my Lord as He descends in clouds of gloryTo take me home to that place where peace abounds.There'll be joy in ev'ry heart that goes to meet Him,There'll be peace in our songs of praise and love;Then He'll take us to that land where we shall see HimWho gave His Son that we might dwell with Him above.
