Father of mercies, in Thy WordWhat endless glory shines!Forever by Thy name adoredFor these celestial lines.

Here springs of consolation riseTo cheer the fainting mind,And thirsty souls receive supplies,And sweet refreshment find.

O may these heav’nly pages beMy ever dear delight,And still new beauties may I see,And still increasing light.

Divine instructor, gracious Lord,Be Thou forever near;Teach me to love Thy sacred Word,And find my Savior there.Amen.
