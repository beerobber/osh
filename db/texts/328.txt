Lord, help me live from day to dayIn such a self-forgetful way That even when I kneel to prayMy prayer shall be for others.

Help me in all the work I doTo ever be sincere and trueAnd know that all I'd do for youMust needs be done for others.

Let "Self" be crucified and slainAnd buried deep: and all in vainMay efforts be to rise again,Unless to live for others.

And when my work on earth is done,And my new work in Heav'n's begun,May I forget the race I've run,And praise my Lord with others.


Others, Lord, yes, others,Let this my motto be,Help me to live for others,That I may live like Thee.
