How sweet, how heav'nly is the sight, When those who love the Lord In one another's peace delight, And so fulfill His word.

When each can feel his brother's sigh, And with him bear a part;When sorrow flows from eye to eye, And joy from heart to heart.

Let love in one delightful stream, Thru ev'ry bosom flow; And union sweet with fond esteem, In ev'ry action glow.

Love is the golden chain that binds The happy souls above,And he's an heir of heav'n who finds His bosom glow with love.
