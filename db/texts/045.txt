When the world my heart is rendingWith its heaviest storm of care,My glad tho’ts to God ascendingFind a refuge from despair.

There’s a hand of mercy near me,Tho’ the waves of trouble roar;There’s an hour of rest to cheer meWhen the toils of life are o’er.

Oh, to rest in peace forever,Joined with happy souls above!Where no foe my heart can severFrom the Savior whom I love.

This the hope that shall sustain meTill life’s pilgrimage is past:Tears may vex and trouble pain me;I shall reach my home at last.





I love Jesus! Hallelujah!I love Jesus, yes I do;I do love Jesus,He’s my Savior;Jesus smiles and loves me too.
