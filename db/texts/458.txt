Rejoice, the Lord is King, Your God and King adore;Mortals, give thanks and sing,And triumph evermore!

Rejoice, the Savior reigns,The God of truth and love;When He had purged our stains,He took His seat above.

His kingdom cannot fail,He rules o’er earth and heav’n;The keys of death and hell Are to our Jesus giv’n.







Lift up the heart, Lift up the voice,Rejoice aloud,Ye saints, rejoice!

Lift up the heart, Lift up the voice,Rejoice aloud,
