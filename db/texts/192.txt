The wilderness shall be glad for them; And the desert shall rejoice as a blossoming rose! It shall blossom with joyful songs to the Lord; Joy of Carmel and Sharon, His majesty know. 

Gain strength weak hands, stand fast feeble knees; Fear thou not fearful heart, behold your God! He shall come with a vengeance and recompence; Come to conquer your foes    — the winepress to trod. 

Then shall the lame man leap as a hart, And the tongue of the dumb shall loosen to sing! For the waters shall spring from the dry desert land, As the anthems announce the conquering King. 

Ye wayworn souls see the path set before, It's the way of the righteous the way of the Lord! There no foe nor a danger shall ever be found. The redeemed of Jehovah walk safe with their Lord! 

They shall obtain true joy and peace For no sorrow, no sighing, no more tears shall be shed. And the ransomed of God shall return to the Mount With sweet songs everlasting and joy on their heads!
