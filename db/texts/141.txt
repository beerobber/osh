Who is this that comes from farWith His garments dipped in blood?Strong, triumphant traveler,Is He man or is He God?I that reign in righteousness,Son of God and man I am;Mighty to redeem your race,Jesus is your Savior's name.

Wide, ye heav'nly gates, unfold,Closed no more by death and sin;Lo, the conqu'ring Lord behold,Let the King of glory in;Hark th'Êangelic host inquire,ÒWho is He, th'Êalmighty King?ÓHark again the answ'ring choir,Thus in strains of triumph sing.

He whose pow'rful arm aloneOn His foes destruction hurled,He who hath the vict'ry won,He who saved you by His blood,He who God's pure law fulfilled,Jesus, the Incarnate Word;He whose truth with blood was sealed,He is heav'n's allglor'ous Lord.
