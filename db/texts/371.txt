When the day of life is brightest,Love the fondest, hope most free,And the steps of time are lightest,O my Father, lead Thou me.

When the night of life is darkest,And my soul shall tempted be;When to sorrow’s voice I listen,O my Father, lead Thou me.

Be life’s pathway smooth or stony,Let my faith still cling to Thee;Be life’s future bright or stormy,O my Father, lead Thou me.







Father, Father, wilt Thou lead me?O my Father, lead Thou me;And the steps of time beat lightest;O my Father, lead Thou me.
