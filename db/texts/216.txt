On Jordan’s stormy banks I stand,And cast a wishful eye,To Canaan’s fair and happy land,Where my possessions lie.

O’er all those wide extended plains,Shines one eternal day,There God the Son forever reigns,And scatters night away.

No chilling winds, nor pois’nous breathCan reach that healthful shore,Sickness and sorrow, pain and deathAre felt and feared no more.

When shall I reach that happy place,And be forever blest?When shall I see my Father’s face,And in His bosom rest?





I am bound for the promised land,I am bound for the promised land;O who will come and go with me?I am bound for the promised land.

promised land,
