Did Christ the great example leadFor all His humble trainIn washing the disciples feetAnd wiping them again?

And did my Lord and Master say,If I have washed your feet,Ye also ought to watch and pray,And wash each other’s feet?

In imitation of my LordWhose blood for me ’tis sweet,I yield unto His sacred wordAnd wash the pilgrim’s feet.

Yea, blessed Jesus, I like themWould Christians often meet;The least of all the flock would be,And wash His children’s feet.
