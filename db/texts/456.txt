Am I a soldier of the cross,A foll'wer of the Lamb?And shall I fear to own His cause,Or blush to speak His name?Must I be carried to the skies On flow'ry beds of ease,While others fought to win the prize,And sailed thru bloody seas?

Are there no foes for me to face?Must I not stem the flood?Is this vile world a friend to grace,To help me on to God?Sure I would fight if I would reign;Increase my courage, Lord.I'll bear the toil, endure the pain,Supported by Thy word.

Thy saints in all this glor'ous warShall conquer tho' they die;They see the triumph from afar,By faith it is bro't nigh.When that illustr'ous day shall rise,And all Thine armies shineIn robes of vict'ry thru the skies,The glory shall be Thine.
