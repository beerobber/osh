My spirit looks to God alone;My rock and refuge is His throne.In all my fears, in all my straits,My soul on His salvation waits.

Trust Him, ye saints, in all your ways;Pour out your hearts before His face.When helpers fail, and foes invade,God is our all sufficient aid.

Yea and amen His promise is,His Word is filled with godly bliss.'Tis such a joy to feel His love;I'll live for Him, Who reigns above.
