In Thy great name, O Lord, we comeTo worship at Thy feet;Oh, pour Thy Holy Spirit downOn all that now shall meet.
We come to hear Jehovah speak,To hear the Savior's voice;Thy face and favor, Lord, we seek;Now make our hearts rejoice.
Teach us to pray, and praise, and hear,And understand Thy word;To feel Thy blissful presence near,And trust our living Lord.

Let sinners now Thy goodness prove,And saints rejoice in Thee;Let rebels be subdued by love,And to the Savior flee.
