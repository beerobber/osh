Exalt the Lord, Oh soul of mine, And worship at His feet; Exalt the Lord, Oh soul of mine, And worship at His feet. To make their praise complete; Let heav'n and earth and sea combine To make their praise complete! 

Exalt the Lord, Ye much loved saints, With all thy heart and soul; Exalt the Lord, Ye much loved saints, With all your heart and soul. And His great name extol; Throw off all earthly, vain restraints And His great name extol!

Exalt the Lord, With ev'ry breath While anthems to Him raise; Exalt the Lord, With ev'ry breath While anthems to Him raise. Yield up our lives in praise; And may we in the hour of death Yield up our lives in praise!
