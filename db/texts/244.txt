I have a feeling from inside,My Lord is coming to His Bride;And when He comes, I want to seeThe glor’ous meeting it will be.

Since He has gone, she’s lonely here,And often feels the burning tear;She is now waiting not in vainFor her dear Lord to come again.

And when He comes, the angels say,She has no guilt to wash away,For all her sins, even the dross,Were put away on Calv’ry’s cross.

And now in mansions bright and fairShe’ll ever live with Him up there;No sorrows there can ever come,Eternally with Christ at home.





He has a mansion where they’ll meetTo part no more, the tho’t is sweet;And they together ever stayIn that sweet home of endless day.

He has a more, the tho’t is sweet, supremely sweet; And they of endless day. mansion where they’ll meet together ever stay;
