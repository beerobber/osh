There is a land, a golden strand,Where saints and angels robed in whiteAre singing praise thru endless daysIn shining worlds of pure delight.

In that sweet home, no more to roam,No more to weep o'er scenes of woe,Safe there at last, all trials past,The wonders of those worlds to know.

O morning fair, O glories rare!When on that happy golden shore,With loved ones meet, with joy complete,I'll live with them forevermore.

Some happy time in yonder climeBeyond the reach of pain and care,In lands of spring where angels sing,I'll live forever over there.





In worlds on high, in yonder sky,Are dazzling mansions bright and fair;I'll fly away some happy day,And live forever over there.

In worlds on high, in yonder sky,I'll fly away some happy day,
