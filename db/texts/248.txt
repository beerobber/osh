O they tell me of a home far beyond the skies,O they tell me of a home far away;O they tell me of a home where no stormclouds rise,O they tell me of an unclouded day.

O they tell me of a home where my friends have gone,O they tell me of that land far away;Where the tree of life, in eternal bloom,Sheds its fragrance thru the unclouded day.

O they tell me of the King in His beauty there,And they tell me that mine eyes shall beholdWhere He sits on the throne that is whiter than snow,In the city that is made of pure gold.

O they tell me that He smiles on His children there,And His smile will drive their sorrows away;And they tell me that no tears ever come againIn that lovely land of unclouded day.





O the land of cloudless day,O the land of an unclouded sky;

D.S.ÐO they tell me of a home where no stormclouds rise,O they tell me of an unclouded day.Ê
