Once from my poor sin-sick soul,Christ did ev'ry burden roll;Now I walk redeemed and whole,Hand in hand with Jesus.

In my night of dark despair,Jesus heard and answered prayer;Now I'm walking free as air,Hand in hand with Jesus.

When the stars are backward rolled,And His home I shall behold;I will walk those streets of gold,Hand in hand with Jesus.
Walking thus, I cannot stray,Hand in hand with Jesus.Hand in hand we walk each day,Hand in hand along the way;
