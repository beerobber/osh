Far away the noise of strife upon my ear is falling, Then I know the sins of earth beset on ev’ry hand; Doubt and fear and things of earth in vain to me are calling; None of these shall move me from Beulah Land.

Far below the storm of doubt upon the world is beating; Sons of men in battle long the enemy withstand; Safe am I within the castle of God’s word retreating; Nothing there can reach me  — ’tis Beulah Land. 

Let the stormy breezes blow, their cry cannot alarm me; I am safely sheltered here, protected by God’s hand; Here the sun is always shining, here there’s naught can harm me; I am safe forever in Beulah Land. 

Viewing here the works of God, I sink in contemplation; Hearing now His blessed voice, I see the way He planned; Dwelling in the Spirit, here I learn of full salvation; Gladly will I tarry in Beulah Land.





I’m living on the mountain, underneath a cloudless sky, I’m drinking at the fountain that never shall run dry, O yes! I’m feasting on the manna from a bountiful supply, For I am dwell ing in Beulah Land.

Praise God!
