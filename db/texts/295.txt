Prayer is the soul's sincere desire,Unuttered or expressed;The motion of a hidden fireThat trembles in the breast.

Prayer is the simplest form of speechThat infant lips can try;Prayer, the sublimest strains that reachThe Majesty on high.

Prayer is the contrite sinner's voice,Returning from his ways;While angels in their songs rejoice,And cry, Behold he prays!

O Thou, by whom we come to God,The life, the truth, the way,The path of prayer Thyself hast trod;Lord, teach us how to pray!Amen.Ê
