Come, ye humble and poor,And your Savior adore,Who has gone to prepare you a place;He has made you an heir,And by grace will prepare,And will help you in running your race.

Come, ye hungry and faint,And who feel to repent,You shall feed on the fullness of love;There are blessings that flowFor the thirsty below,From that wonderful fountain above.

Come, ye weary withinFrom the burdens of sin,For our Savior has promised you rest;Yes, His burden is light,And His yoke brings delight,And each effort of love shall be blessed.

Then no longer delay,You should work while it’s day,And abide in the light of the Lord;Let us walk in the wayAs the children of day,And delight in the truths of His word.
