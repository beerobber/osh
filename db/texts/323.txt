O how happy are theyWho their Savior obey,And whose treasures are laid up above!Tongue can never express The sweet comfort and peaceOf a soul in its earliest love.

That sweet comfort was mineWhen the favor divineI first found in the blood of the Lamb;When the truth I believed, O what joy I received!What a heaven in Jesus’ sweet name!

’Twas a heaven belowMy Redeemer to know,And the angels could do nothing moreThan to fall at His feetAnd the story repeat,And the Lover of sinners adore.

Jesus all the day long,Was my joy and my song;O that all His salvation might see!“He hath loved me!” I cried,“He hath suffered and died,All to purchase redemption for me.”

O the rapturous light Of that holy delight,Which was shed thru the lifegiving blood!Of my Savior possessed,I was perfectly blest,As if filled with the fullness of God.

Now my remnant of daysWould I spend to His praise,Who has died my poor soul to redeem;Whether many or few,All my years are His due;May they all be devoted to Him.
