I've reached the land of corn and wine,And all its riches freely mine;Here shines undimmed one blissful day,For all my nights have passed away.

My Savior comes and walks with me,And sweet communion here have we;He gently leads me by His handFor this is Heaven's borderland.

A sweet perfume upon the breezeIs borne from ever vernal trees,And flow'rs that never fading growWhere streams of life forever flow.

The zephyrs seem to float to meSweet sounds of Heaven's melody,As angels with the white-robed throngJoin in the sweet redemption song.


O Beulah Land, sweet Beulah Land,As on thy highest mount I stand,I look away across the sea,Where mansions are prepared for me,And view the shining glory shore,My Heav'n, my home forevermore!
