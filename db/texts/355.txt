In the rifted Rock I'm resting;Safely sheltered, I abide.There no foes nor storms molest me,While within the cleft I hide.

Long pursued by sin and Satan,Weary, sad, I longed for rest.Then I found this heav'nly shelter Opened in my Saviour's breast.

Peace which passeth understanding,Joy the world can never give,Now in Jesus I am finding;In His smiles of love I live.

In the rifted Rock I'll hide meTill the storm of life is past;All secure in this blest refuge,Heeding not the fiercest blast.


Now I'm resting, sweetly resting,In the cleft once made for me.Jesus, blessed Rock of Ages,I will hide myself in Thee.
