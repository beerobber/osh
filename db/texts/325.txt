Sweet is the work, my God,  my King,To praise Thy name, give thanks and sing,To show Thy love by morning light,And talk of all Thy truth at night.

Sweet is the day of sacred rest;No mortal care shall seize my breast;Oh! may my heart in tune be found,Like David's harp of solemn sound. 

My heart shall triumph in my Lord,And bless His works and bless His word;Thy works of grace, how bright they shine,How deep Thy counsels! how divine!

Then I shall share a glorious part,When grace hath well refined my heart,And fresh supplies of joy are shedLike holy oil upon my head.

Then shall I see, and hear and knowAll I desire or wished below;And ev'ry pow'r find sweet employIn that eternal world of joy.
