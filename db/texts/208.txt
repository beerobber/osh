Christ the Lord is ris’n today, Alleluia! Earth and heav’n in chorus say, Alleluia! Raise your joys and triumphs high, Alleluia! Sing, ye heav’ns, and earth reply, Alleluia! 

Love’s redeeming work is done, Alleluia! Fought the fight, the battle won, Alleluia! Death in vain forbids Him rise, Alleluia! Christ has opened paradise, Alleluia! 

Lives again our glorious King, Alleluia! Where, O death, is now thy sting? Alleluia! Once He died our souls to save, Alleluia! Where’s thy  vict’ry, boasting grave? Alleluia! 

Soar we now where Christ has led, Alleluia! Foll’wing   our   exalted Head, Alleluia! Made like Him, like Him we rise, Alleluia! Ours     the cross, the grave, the skies, Alleluia! 

Hail the Lord of earth and heav’n, Alleluia! Praise to Thee by both be giv’n, Alleluia! Thee we greet triumphant now, Alleluia! Hail  the Resurrection, Thou, Alleluia! 

King of glory, soul of bliss, Alleluia! Everlasting life is this, Alleluia! Thee to know, Thy pow’r to prove, Alleluia! Thus  to sing, and thus to love, Alleluia! Amen.
