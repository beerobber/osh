Lord, in the morning Thou shalt hear 
My voice ascending high; 
To Thee will I direct my prayer, 
To To Thee lift up mine eye.

Up to the hills where Christ is gone 
To plead for all His saints, 
Presenting at His Father's throne 
Our songs and our complaints.

O, may Thy Spirit guide my feet 
In ways of righteousness, 
Make ev'ry path of duty straight, 
And plain before my face.
