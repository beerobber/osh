O sometimes the shadows are deep,And rough seems the path to the goal,And sorrows, sometimes how they sweepLike tempests down over the soul!
O sometimes how long seems the day,And sometimes how weary my feet;But toiling in life's dusty way,The Rock's blessed shadow, how sweet!

O near to the Rock let me keepIf blessings or sorrows prevail,Or climbing the mountain way steep,Or walking the shadowy vale.

O then to the Rock let me fly,To the Rock that is higher than I;O then to the Rock let me fly,To the Rock that is higher than I!

let me fly, is higher than I; let me fly,
