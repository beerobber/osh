Master, O why do the clouds hang low?ÊWhy does the sun no longer glow?Why is my going so staid and slowOver the sands of time?Thru the dark skies, O let me seeGlimmerings of eternity,Holding a welcoming light for meOver the path divine.
Give us the courage to bear our cross,Counting our life as all but loss;Sweeten the purging of ev'ry dross,Bringing us forth as gold.Tell us, O Lord, Thou art not far,Come in Thy love right where we are;O for a gleam of that great Day Star,Shining within our soul.

Life is a tangle of toil and care,Doubts and dark fears, so hard to bear,Frighten our soul from its bow'r of prayerWhen Thou art far away.Grant us thru faith an open door,Looking beyond this earthly shore,Where the poor pilgrim will doubt no more,In that eternal day.
