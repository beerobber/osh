Salvation! O the joyful sound!'Tis pleasure to our ears,A sov'reign balm for ev'ry wound,A cordial for our fears.

Buried in sorrow and in sin,At hell's dark door we lay;But we arise by grace divineTo see a heav'nly day.

Salvation! Let the echo flyThe spacious earth around,While all the armies of the skyConspire to raise the sound.
