There's hope in the Name of Jesus, There's hope in the Bleeding Tide; There's hope for the fallen Adam, There's hope for the heart that died. There's hope for the weary pilgrim, There's hope for the happy saint; There's hope for the Òtrembling jailor,Ó There's hope for the weak and faint. 

There's hope for the outcast pris'ner, There's hope for the glad and free; There's hope for the "weeping Mary," There's hope for the blind to see. There's hope for the heart rejoicing, There's hope for the mourner's tear; There's hope for the bold and courageous, There's hope when we're filled with fear. 

There's hope when our path way shines brightly, There's hope when we poorly see; There's hope in the Name of Jesus, I hope that He died for me! There's hope for the fallen Adam, There's hope for the heart that died; There's hope in the Name of Jesus, There's hope in the Bleeding Tide.
