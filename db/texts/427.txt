When my way groweth drear, precious Lord, linger near,When my life is almost gone;Hear my cry, hear my call, hold my hand lest I fall;Take my hand, precious Lord, lead me home.

When the shadows appear, and the night draweth near,And the day is past and gone;At the river I stand, guide my feet, hold my hand;Take my hand, precious Lord, lead me home.









CHO.ÐPrecious Lord, take my hand, lead me on, let me stand,I am tired, I am weak, I am worn,Thru the storm, thru the night, lead me on to the light;Take my hand, precious Lord, lead me home.
