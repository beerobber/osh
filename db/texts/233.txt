Face to face with Christ, my Savior,Face to face, what will it be,When with rapture I behold Him,Jesus Christ who died for me?

Only faintly now I see Him,With the darkened veil between,But a blessed day is comingWhen His glory shall be seen.

What rejoicing in His presenceWhen are banished grief and pain,When the crooked ways are straightened,And the dark things shall be plain.

Face to face! O blissful moment!Face to face to see and know;Face to face with my Redeemer,Jesus Christ who loves me so.





Face to face I shall behold Him,Far beyond the starry sky;Face to face in all His glory,I shall see Him by and by!
