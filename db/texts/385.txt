Oh! for a breeze of heav’nly loveTo waft my soul awayTo that celestial world aboveWhere pleasures ne’er decay.Eternal Spirit, deign to beMy Pilot here below,To steer thru life’s tempest’ous seaWhere stormy winds do blow.

I need the influence of Thy graceTo speed me on my way.Lest I should loiter in my race,Or turn my feet astray.Are not Thy mercies sov’reign still,And Thou a faithful God?Wilt Thou not grant me warmer zealTo run the heav’nly road?

From rocks of pride on either hand,From quicksands of despair,Oh, guide me safe on Canaan’s land,Thru ev’ry latent snare.Anchor me in that port aboveOn that celestial shore,Where dashing billows never move,Where tempests never roar.
