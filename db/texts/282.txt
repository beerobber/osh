Jesus Christ, our loving friend,On whom our hopes of Heav’n depend,Hear us when we cry to Thee,Author of our liberty.

When at Thy throne we try to pray,These precious thoughts our words convey;From Thine embrace we cannot fall;Thou art our life, our all in all.

Now in this hour we need Thy love,Thy blessings straight from Heav’n above;That we so hungry may be fedWith truths of life our daily bread.
