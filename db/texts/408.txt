O, tell me no more of this world's vain store, The time for such trifles with me now is o'er; A country I've found where true joys abound; To dwell I'm determined on that happy ground.  

No mortal will know what Christ will bestow, What joy, strength, and comfort do after Him go; Lo! onward I move to see Christ above; None guesses how wondrous my journey will prove.  

Great spoils I shall win from death, hell, and sin, 'Midst outward affliction shall feel Christ within; And still, which is best, I in  His dear breast, As at the beginning, find pardon and rest.  

When I am to die, receive me, I'll cry, For Jesus has loved me, I cannot tell why; But this I do find: we two are so joined, He'll not live in glory and leave me behind.   

This blessing is mine thru favor divine, And, O, my dear Jesus, the praise shall be Thine; In heaven we'll meet in harmony sweet, And glory to Jesus! we'll then be complete.
