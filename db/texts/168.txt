How shall a man be just with God, Whose righteousness mounts to the sky? There's no man between us to reconcile! No water can cleanse my hands, so vile. 

I find a law dwelling in my flesh Commanding my heart to sin. Oh, wretched man! Oh, body of death! Shall any deliver, and give me rest? 

Comfort I find in a voice that proclaims, ÒThou hast received double for sin! Your warfare's accomplished, from death thou art freed! For Christ was made sin, and died for thee.Ó 

I was His foe; still, He bore my sins, And suffered God's wrath in my stead! Behold this great love: Christ laid down His life! Now by His shed blood I am justified. 

All of my days in assurance I'll wait, For I know there's coming a change! Mine eyes shall behold Him, Alive evermore; And so I shall ever be with the Lord.
