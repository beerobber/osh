There is a happy land,Far, far away,Where saints in glory stand,Bright, bright as day;Oh, how they sweetly sing,ÒWorthy is our Savior, King!Loud let His praises ring,Praise, praise for aye!Ó

Oh, to that happy landChrist went away,Who does in glory stand,While we delay;Oh, we shall happy beWhen from sin and sorrow free;Lord we shall live with Thee,Blest, blest for aye!

Bright in that happy landBeams ev'ry eye,Kept by the Father's hand,Love cannot die;Oh, then to glory run,Soon we'll share this glor'ous home,And bright above the sunWe'll reign for aye!
