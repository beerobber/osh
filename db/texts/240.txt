My latest sun is sinking fast,My race is nearly run;My strongest trials now are past,My triumph is begun.

I know I'm near the holy ranksOf friends and kindred dear,I brush the dew on Jordan's banks,The crossing must be near.

I've almost gained my heav'nly home,My spirit loudly sings;The holy ones, behold they come!I hear the noise of wings.Ê

O bear my longing heart to HimWho bled and died for me,Whose blood now cleanses from all sin,And gives me victory.

O come, angel band,Come, and around me stand;O bear me away on your snowy wingsTo my immortal home;O bear me away on your snowy wingsTo my immortal home.
