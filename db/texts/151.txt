Grace, ’tis a charming sound,Harmon’ous to the ear!Heav’n with the echo shall resound,And all the saints shall hear.

Grace first contrived the wayTo save rebell’ous man;And all the steps that grace display,Which drew the wondrous plan.

Grace first inscribed my nameIn God’s eternal book;’Twas grace that gave me to the Lamb,Who all my sorrows took.

Grace led my roving feetTo tread the heav’nly road;And new supplies each hour I meet,While pressing on to God.

Grace taught my soul to pray,And made mine eyes o’erflow;’Twas grace that kept me to this day,And will not let me go.

Grace all the work shall crown,Thru everlasting days;It lays in Heav’n the topmost stone, And well deserves the praise.
