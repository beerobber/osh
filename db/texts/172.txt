Out of my guilt I tried to prayThat God would open up the way,And lift me from this sinful place To tell the story, "Saved by grace."

Now here I am at mercy's door,The place appointed for the poor;Oh! let me see Thy lovely face,And tell the story, "Saved by grace."

My prayers went up, a feeble cry,"Now save, dear Lord, or I must die;"He lifted me from this low baseTo tell the story, "Saved by grace."

My Savior died on Calv'ry's treeTo buy a home in Heav'n for me;He raised me to a blessed placeTo tell the story, "Saved by grace."

The weariness of years has come,And I perhaps am near my home;I hope to reach that happy place,And tell the story, "Saved by grace."

The shadows fall, and life seems vain,Our bodies come to dust again,Then raised to see Him face to face,We'll tell the story, "Saved by grace."

Oh, let me feel Thy sweet embrace,And tell the story, "Saved by grace;"Oh, let me feel Thy sweet embrace,And tell the story, "Saved by grace."

 yes, feel embrace, yes, feel embrace,
