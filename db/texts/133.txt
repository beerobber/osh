Faith is the brightest evidenceOf things beyond our sight;It pierces thru the veil of sense,And dwells in heav'nly light. 

It sets times past in present view,Brings distant prospects home;Of things a thousand years ago,Or thousand years to come.

By faith we know the worlds were madeBy God's almighty Word;Abra'm to unknown countries led,By faith obeyed the Lord.

He sought a city fair and high,Built by th'Êeternal hands;And faith assures us, tho' we die,That heav'nly building stands.
