I'm kind of homesick for a countryTo which I've never been before;No sad goodbyes will there be spokenFor time won't matter anymore.

I'm looking now across the river,Where my faith will end in sight;There's just a few more days to labor,Then I will take my heav'nly flight.

I see the lights, I hear the singing,A lovely song of joy divine;My soul rejoices just in knowingThat soon these pleasures shall be mine.



Beulah Land, I'm longing for you,And, someday, on thee I'll stand;There my home shall be eternal,Beulah Land, sweet Beulah Land.
