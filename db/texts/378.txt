The Lord is my light and my joy ev'ry day,He leads me in righteous paths all of the way;I follow Him trusting, and hold to His hand,I hope he will take me to heaven's fair land.

He leadeth by waters so quiet and still,ÊMy soul with His goodness each day He doth fill;My cup runneth over with blessings divine,His love is my story, his goodness is mine.

I walk in this light as I travel along,He fills me each moment with jubilant song;I talk with Him often, and sweet is His voice,In this blessed Savior my soul shall rejoice.

The Lord is the light of my soul,I live ev'ry day in His blessed control,His love keeps me singing as onward I go,The joy of salvation is mine;I joyfully praise Him with heart and with voice,Because in His love, His great love I rejoice,ÊO He is the one blessed light of my soul,This wonderful Savior Divine. 

The Lord is the light, I live ev'ry day salvation is mine; I joyfully praise Because in His love, His great this Savior Divine.
