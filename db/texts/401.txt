Come what may of joy or sorrow,Be my portion pain or rest,Jesus guides me and directs me,And His way is always best.

I would never choose my pathway,But by faith would walk with Him,Trusting ever and believing,If the skies are bright or dim.

Jesus sees if heavyheartedI am toiling on life's road,And with love He lifts the shadowsThat obscure His blest abode.

Jesus calls me to be faithful,To be helpful as I roam,And when toils and tears are ended,He will bid His child, "Come home."


Jesus knows, Jesus knows,All the way my feet must go;Jesus knows, Jesus knows,Him I trust who loves me so.

Jesus knows, Jesus knows, All the way feet must go; Jesus knows, Jesus knows, Him I trust loves me so.
