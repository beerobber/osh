Down to the sacred waveThe Lord of life was led,And He who came our souls to saveIn Jordan bowed His head.

He taught the solemn way,He fixed the holy rite,He bade His ransomed ones obey,And keep the path in sight.

The Holy Ghost came down,His baptism to approve,The ordinance of Christ to crown,And stamp it with His love.

Dear Savior, we will treadIn Thine appointed way;Let glory o’er these scenes be shed,And smile on us today.
