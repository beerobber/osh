Christians, if your hearts are warm,Ice and snow can do no harm;If by Jesus you are prized,Rise, believe, and be baptized.

Jesus drank the gall for you,Bore the curse for sinners due;Children, prove your love to Him,Never fear the frozen stream.

Never shun the Savior’s cross,All on earth is worthless dross;If the Savior’s love you feel,Let the world behold your zeal.

Ev’ry season of the year,Let your worship be sincere;When the storm prevents your roam,Serve your gracious Lord at home.

Read His sacred word by day,Ever watching, always pray,Meditate His law by night,This will give you great delight.
