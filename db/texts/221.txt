God’s angels encampeth’Round them that fear Him;We may not behold them,Our vision is dim.

Ye heirs of salvation, God’s angels are near;They’re sent to protect you,Then why should you fear?

If our eyes are openedAs onward we plod,We’ll see all the horsemenAnd chariots of God.

O stand by me, angels,When life here is o’er;Then on your white pinionsBear me to your shore.





O bear me up, angels,Across life’s shifting sand;Lest I should stumble,Bear me up in your hands.
