When Moses and the Israelites from Egypt's land did flee,Behind them were proud Pharaoh's host, in front of them the sea;God raised the waters like a wall and opened up the way,And the God that lived in the olden times is just the same today.

When David and Goliath met, the wrong against the right,The giant armed with human strength and David with God's might,God sent a stone by David's sling, the giant low did lay,

When Daniel, faithful to his God, would not bow down to men,And by his enemies was hurled into the lions' den,God shut the lions' mouths, we read, and robbed them of their prey,
When Pentecost had fully come, and fire from Heav'n did fall,The Savior with the Holy Ghost baptized them one and all;Three thousand were converted and were added right away,
He's just the same today, He's just the same today!
