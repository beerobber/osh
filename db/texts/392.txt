Ye fleeting charms of earth, farewell,Your springs of joy are dry.My soul now seeks another home,A brighter world on high.

Farewell, ye friends whose tender careHas long engaged my love;Your fond embrace I now exchangeFor better friends above.

Cheerful, I leave this vale of tears,Where pains and sorrows grow;Welcome the day that ends my toilAnd ev’ry scene of woe.

Fly, then, ye interposing days,Lord, send the summons down;The hand that strikes me to the dustShall raise me to a crown.





I’m a long time trav’ling here below,I’m a long time trav’ling away from home;I’m a long time trav’ling here belowTo lay this body down.
