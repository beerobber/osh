Sweetly, Lord, have we heard Thee calling,“Come, follow Me!”And we see where Thy footprints fallingLead us to Thee.

Tho’ they lead o’er the cold, dark mountains,Seeking His sheep,Or along by Siloam’s fountains, Helping the weak.

If they lead thru the temple holy,Preaching the word,Or in homes of the poor and lowly,Serving the Lord.

By and by thru the shining portals,Turning our feet,We shall walk with the glad immortals,Heav’n’s golden street.

Then at last, when on high He sees us,Our journey done,We shall rest where the steps of JesusEnd at His throne.



Footprints of JesusThat make the pathway glow;D.S.–We will follow the steps of Jesus,Where’er they go.
