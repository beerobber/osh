I don't know about tomorrow,I just live from day to day;I don't borrow from its sunshine,For its skies may turn to gray;I don't worry o'er the future,For I know what Jesus said,And today I'll walk beside Him,For He knows what is ahead.

Ev'ry step is getting brighterAs the golden stairs I climb,Ev'ry burden's getting lighter,Ev'ry cloud is silver lined;There the sun is always shining,There no tear will dim the eye;At the ending of the rainbowWhere the mountains touch the sky.

I don't know about tomorrow,It may bring me poverty,But the One who feeds the sparrowIs the One who stands by me;And the path that be my portionMay be thru the flame or flood,But His presence goes before me,And I'm covered with His blood.

Many things about tomorrowI don't seem to understand;But I know who holds tomorrow,And I know who holds my hand.
