Hark! Ten thousand harps and voices Sound the notes of praise above;Jesus reigns, and heav'n rejoices, Jesus reigns, the God of love;See, He sits on yonder throne; Jesus rules the world alone;Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Jesus rules the world alone.

Jesus, hail! Whose glory brightens All above, and gives it worth;Lord of life, Thy smile enlightens, Cheers, and charms Thy saints on earth;When we think of love like Thine, Lord, we own it love divine;ÊHallelujah! Hallelujah! Lord, we own it love divine.

King of glory, reign forever, Thine an everlasting crown;Nothing from Thy love can sever, Those whom Thou hast made Thine own;Happy objects of Thy grace, Destined to behold Thy face.Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Destined to behold Thy face.

Savior, hasten Thine appearing, Bring, O bring the glor'ous dayWhen the awful summons hearing, Heav'n and earth shall pass away;Then with golden harps we'll sing, "Glory, glory to our King!"Hallelujah! Hallelujah! "Glory, glory to our King!"

















See, He sits on yonder throne; Jesus rules the world alone;
