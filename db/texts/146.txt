Show pity, Lord, O Lord, forgive,Let a repenting rebel live;Are not Thy mercies large and free?May not a sinner trust in Thee?

My crimes are great, but don't surpassThe pow'r and glory of Thy grace;Great God, Thy nature hath no bound,So let Thy pard'ning love be found.

Should sudden vengeance seize my breath,I must pronounce Thee just in death;And if my soul were sent to hell,Thy righteous law approves it well.

Yet save a trembling sinner, Lord,Whose hope, still hov'ring round Thy word,Would light on some sweet promise there,Some sure support against despair.


O depth of mercy! can it beThat mercy's still reserved for me?Ah, can my God His wrath forbear,And me the chief of sinners spare?
