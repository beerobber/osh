All hail to Thee, Immanuel,We cast our crowns before Thee,Let ev’ry heart obey Thy will,And ev’ry voice adore Thee:In praise to Thee, our Savior King,The vibrant chords of heaven ring,And echo back the mighty strain;

All hail to Thee, Immanuel,The ransomed hosts surround Thee,And earthly monarchs clamor forthTheir sov’reign King to crown Thee;While those redeemed in ages gone,Assembled round the great white throne,Break forth into immortal song;

All hail to Thee, Immanuel,Our risen King and Savior!Thy foes are vanquished, and Thou artOmnipotent forever,Death, sin, and hell no longer reign,And Satan’s pow’r is burst in twain,Eternal glory to Thy name;







All hail! all hail!All hail! all hail Immanuel!HailImmanuel! Immanuel! Hail Immanuel! Immanuel!Glory and honor and majesty,Wisdom and power be unto Thee,Now and evermore!King of kings and Lord of lords,All hail Immanuel!

Hail to the King we love so well!Hail Immanuel! Hail to the King we love so well!Hail Immanuel! Glory and majesty,Wisdom be unto Thee,
