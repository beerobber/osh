Sweet rivers of redeeming loveLie just before mine eyes.Had I the pinions of a dove,I’d to those rivers rise.I’d rise superior to my pain,With joy outstrip the wind,And cross bold Jordan’s stormy main,And leave this world behind.

While I’m imprisoned here belowIn anguish, pain and smart,Ofttimes my troubles I foregoWhile love surrounds my heart.In darkest shadows of the nightFaith mounts the upper sky,I then behold my heart’s delight,And could rejoice to die!

I view the monster Death and smile,For he has lost his sting,And Satan trembles all the while,Triumphant I can sing;I hold my Savior in my arms,And will not let Him go;I’m so delighted with His charms,No other good I know.

A few more days or years at most,My troubles will be o’er,And I shall join the heav’nly hostOn Canaan’s peaceful shore.My happy soul will drink and feastOn love’s unbounded sea,The glor’ous hope of endless restIs pleasing news to me.
