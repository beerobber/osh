Many things step in the wayThat will lead us far astray;But, with Thee, Lord, I can stand,Savior, hold me by Thy hand.


When the fearful billows roar,And I'm drifting far from shore,Storms obey, Lord, Thy command,Savior, hold me by Thy hand.

When the fearful billows roar, yes, when the fearful billows roar, And I'm drifting, I am drifting far from shore, Storms obey Thy blest command, the blessed Savior's true command, Savior hold
