Here in the vineyard of my Lord I love to live and labor,And be obedient to my GodUntil my dying hour.I love to see the lilies grow,And view them all astandingIn the right place while here below,Just as the Lord commanded.

We ofttimes meet, both night and day,A faithful band of soldiers;We read, we sing, we preach and pray,And find the Lord most precious.But while we sing this song of loveOur hearts are deeply wounded;Perhaps we all may meet no moreHere in a congregation.

But if on earth we meet no more,We hope to meet in heaven,Where congregations ne'er break up,But dwell in sweet communion.Where all the ransomed church of GodShall meet no more to sever,With not a sorrow, sin nor tear,But shout His praise forever.
