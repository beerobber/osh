Long ago, in the beginning,When the earth was dark as night,God in Spirit walked the waters,And He spoke, "Let there be light."God in Spirit walked the waters,And He spoke, "Let there be light."

Then there followed the creationOf all things upon the earth.Thru the voice of the CreatorEv'rything was given birth.Thru the voice of the CreatorEv'rything was given birth. 

"Let us make man in our image,"Spoke the Lord, and it was done.Thus creation was completedBy the Lord, the Three in One.Thus creation was completedBy the Lord, the Three in One.

He has given life eternal,Which can ne'er be hurt by death.Now let all creation praise Him,Praise Him with our living breath.Now let all creation praise Him,Praise Him with our living breath.
