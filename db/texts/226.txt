Out on the ocean all boundless we ride, We're homeward bound, homeward bound;Tossed on the waves of a rough, restless tide, We're homeward bound, homeward bound;Far from the safe, quiet harbor we rode, Far from our Father's celestial abode,Promise of which on us He hath bestowed, We're homeward bound, homeward bound. 

Wildly the storm sweeps us on as it roars, We're homeward bound, homeward bound;Look! yonder lie the bright heavenly shores, We're homeward bound, homeward bound;Fear not, the Pilot stands firm at the wheel; Fear not, we soon shall outweather the gale;Oh, how we fly 'neath the loud creaking sail, We're homeward bound, homeward bound. 

We'll tell the saints as we journey along, We're homeward bound, homeward bound;Try to persuade them to join in our song, We're homeward bound, homeward bound;Come, trembling pilgrim, forlorn and oppressed, Join in our number;Oh, come and find rest; Journey with us in the way of the blest; We're homeward bound, homeward bound. 

Into the harbor of heav'n  now we glide, We're homeward bound, homeward bound;Softly we drift on its bright silver tide, We're homeward bound, homeward bound;Glory to God! all our sorrows are o'er, We stand secure on the glorified shore;Glory to God, we will shout evermore, We're home at last, home at  last.
