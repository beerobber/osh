O for a heart to praise my God,A heart from sin set free,A heart that always feels Thy blood,So freely spilt for me!

A heart resigned, submissive, meek,My great Redeemer's throne,Where only Christ is heard to speak,Where Jesus reigns alone.

O for a lowly, contrite heart,Believing, true, and clean,Which neither life nor death can partFrom Him that dwells within.

A heart in ev'ry tho't renewedAnd full of love divine;Perfect and right and pure and goodA copy, Lord, of Thine.
