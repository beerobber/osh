My heav'nly home is bright and fair,I feel like traveling on,Nor pain, nor death can enter there,I feel like traveling on.

Its glitt'ring tow'rs the sun outshine,I feel like traveling on,That heav'nly mansion shall be mine,I feel like traveling on.

Let others seek a home below,I feel like traveling on,Which flames devour, or waves o'erflow,I feel like traveling on.

Be mine a happier lot to own,I feel like traveling on,A heav'nly mansion near the throne,I feel like traveling on.

The Lord has been so good to me,I feel like traveling on,Until that blessed home I see,I feel like traveling on.



Yes, I feel like traveling on,I feel like traveling on;My heav'nly home is bright and fair,I feel like traveling on.Ê

traveling on, traveling on;
