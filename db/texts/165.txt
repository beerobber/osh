O wretched sinner that I am! God's love too great to comprehend; The breadth, and length, the depth, and height;  And now to know the love of Christ! 

O wretched sinner, Who am I? To have the blood of Christ applied! Now when my soul is sinking down, How sweet to hear the glorious sound. 

O who is worthy of God's grace?  Search thru all of Adam's race From dawn of time and counting down, Not one in heav'n or earth is found. 

But wait, O thou, who weepest sore:  Dry thine eyes and weep no more! Behold, the Lamb of God prevailed, To save his children without fail. 





"It is finished," was the cry. He bowed His head and then He died! The price for ruined sinners paid, When all our guilt on Christ was laid.
