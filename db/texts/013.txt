How lovely the place where the Savior appearsTo those who believe in His word! His presence disperses my sorrows and fears, And bids me rejoice in my Lord.

One day in His courts than a thousand beside, Is better and lovelier far; My soul hates the place where the wicked reside, And all their delights I abhor.

Lord, give me a place with the humblest of saints, For low at Thy feet I would lie; I know that Thou hearest my feeble complaints, Thou hearest the young raven’s cry.

Give strength to the souls that now wait upon Thee;Oh, come in Thy chariot of love; From earth’s vain enchantments, oh, help us to flee, And set our affections above. 





O for a heart to praise my God,A heart from sin set free,A heart that always feels Thy blood,So freely spilt for me!

A heart resigned, submissive, meek,My great Redeemer’s throne,Where only Christ is heard to speak,Where Jesus reigns alone.

O for a lowly, contrite heart,Believing, true, and clean,Which neither life nor death can partFrom Him that dwells within.

A heart in ev’ry tho’t renewedAnd full of love divine;Perfect and right and pure and good —A copy, Lord, of Thine.





Kindred in Christ, for His dear sake,A hearty welcome here receive;May we together now partakeThe joys which only He can give.

May He by whose kind care we meetSend His good Spirit from above;Make our communications sweet,And cause our hearts to burn with love.

Forgotten be each worldly themeWhen Christians meet together thus;We only wish to speak of HimWho lived, and died, and reigns for us.

We’ll talk of all He did and said,And suffered for us here below;The path He marked for us to tread,And what He’s doing for us now.

Thus as the moments pass away, We’ll love, and wonder, and adore;And hasten on that glor’ous dayWhen we shall meet to part no more.
