Again, from calm and sweet repose,I rise to hail the dawn;Again my waking eyes uncloseTo view the smiling morn.

Great God of love, Thy praise I’ll sing,For Thou hast safely keptMy soul beneath Thy guardian wing,And watched me while I slept.

Glory to Thee, eternal Lord,O teach my heart to pray,And Thy blest Spirit’s help afford,To guide me thru the day.

Let ev’ry tho’t and word accordWith Thy most holy will;Each deed the precepts of Thy word,With pious aim fulfill.

From danger, sin, and ev’ry ill,My constant Guardian prove;O sanctify my heart and fillWith tho’ts of holy love.
