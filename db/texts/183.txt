Who am I, this worm of earth, the chief of sinners still, To be chosen by the Lord, saved by His will? Down below in hell I’d stay in endless misery Had the Son not left God’s side to be made sin for me. 

Who am I, that God revealed His mercy to my soul? His good pleasure once concealed, now freely told. Living sacrifice I’ll be, and follow charity. His right hand and holy arm hath won the victory! 

Who am I, to full obtain inheritance divine, By His own purpose in Christ placed by His side? Who am I to be unblamed and holy in His sight? Oh, to see His smiling face one day in holy light! 







Who am I, Oh Lord God, to have found grace in Thy sight? On my knees, what more can I say: Oh, Lord God, who am I?
