For hope when life was dull and drear,ÊI thank Thee, Lord.For others' smiles and words of cheer,ÊI thank Thee, Lord.When life seemed difficult to bear,And I was all enmeshed in care,You showed me that a way was there;I thank Thee, Lord.

For you I live, not just for me,ÊI thank Thee, Lord.And I am learning constantly,ÊI thank Thee, Lord.Although depraved, You loved me still,And fashioned after Your own will,My empty soul with love did fill;I thank Thee, Lord.

As down my lonely road I trod,ÊI thank Thee, Lord.I wondered if there was a God,ÊI thank Thee, Lord.Facing my own mortality,ÊI fled the world and sought for Thee,You quickly brought me to my knee:I thank Thee, Lord.
