Ye pilgrims of Zion, and chosen of God,Whose spirits are filled with dismay,Since ye have eternal redemption thru blood,Ye cannot but hold on your way.

As Jesus, in covenant love, did engage,A fullness of grace to display,The powers of darkness in malice may rage,The righteous shall hold on his way.

This truth, like its Author, eternal shall stand,Tho' all things in nature decay;Upheld by Jehovah's omnipotent hand,The righteous shall hold on his way.

They may on the main of temptation be toss'd,Their sorrows may swell as the sea;But none of the ransomed shall ever be lost;The righteous shall hold on his way.

Surrounded with sorrows, temptations, and cares,This truth with delight we survey;And sing, as we pass thru this valley of tears,The righteous shall hold on his way.
