I love to steal awhile awayFrom ev'ry cumb'ring care,And spend the hours of setting dayIn humble, grateful prayer.

I love in solitude to shedThe penitential tear,And all His promises to pleadWhere none but God can hear.

I love to think on mercies past,And future good implore,And all my cares and sorrows cast On Him whom I adore.

I love by faith to take a view Of brighter scenes in heav'n;The prospect doth my strength renew,While here by tempest driv'n.

Thus, when life's toilsome day is o'er,May its departing rayBe calm as this impressive hour,And lead to endless day.
