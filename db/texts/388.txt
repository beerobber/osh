In shady green pastures so rich and so sweet,God leads His dear children along;Where the water's cool flow bathes the weary ones' feet,God leads His dear children along.

Sometimes on the mount where the sun shines so bright,God leads His dear children along;Sometimes in the valley in darkest of night,God leads His dear children along.

Tho' sorrows befall us, and Satan oppose,God leads His dear children along;Thru grace we can conquer, defeat all our foes,God leads His dear children along.

Away from the mire and away from the clay,God leads His dear children along;Away up in glory, eternity's day,God leads His dear children along.



Some thru the waters, some thru the flood,Some thru the fire, but all thru the blood;Some thru great sorrow, but God gives a songIn the night season and all the day long.
