As I stand by the side of the mountain,And view the handiwork of God,I’m reminded of life’s flowing fountain,And the rock smitten there by Moses’ rod.

From the mountain my help surely cometh,My feet no more shall e’er be moved;And my cup day by day overfloweth,There the power of God is fully proved.

Here the Lord our own God is the keeper,On the right hand ever is my shade;He’ll prepare us for that silent reaper,There the soul nevermore shall be afraid.







Let me stand by the mountain,Of the clear flowing brooklet drink my fill;Let me rest by the D.S.–fountain,(by the fountain,) And sit down at the top of Zion’s Hill. 

Let me stand by the mountain, Let me rest 









(of the mountain) (living fountain,) 

(surely cometh) (over floweth,) 

 (is the keeper) (silent reaper,)
