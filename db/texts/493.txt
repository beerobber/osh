Oh, what have I done in Thy name, dear Lord,As I come to the close of this day?Have I looked up to heaven and Thee,Or, have my steps gone astray?
Have I let my light shine as it should,Plain enough that others could see?Or, have my deeds been so worthless and boldThat others are blinded to Thee?

How hard, oh how hard is my pilgrimage here;How little the good is in me.But, guide my hands, guide my feet, dear Lord,In paths that will honor Thee.

Oh, what have I done,Oh, what have I done in Thy name, dear Lord, today?Have I looked up to heaven and Thee,ÊOr have my steps gone astray?Or have my steps gone astray?
