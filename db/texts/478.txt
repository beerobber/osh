Poor, weak, and worthless tho' I am,I have a rich Almighty Friend;Jesus, the Savior is His name,He freely loves and without end.He ransomed me from hell with blood,And by His pow'r my foes controlled,He found me wand'ring far from God,And bro't me to His chosen fold.

He cheers my heart, my want supplies,And says that I shall shortly beEnthroned with Him above the skies;O what a Friend is Christ to me!
