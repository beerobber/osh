Depth of mercy! can there beMercy still reserved for me?Can my God His wrath forbear?Me, the chief of sinners spare?

I have long withstood His grace,Long provoked Him to His face;Would not harken to His calls,ÊGrieved Him by a thousand falls.

Kindled His relentings are,Me He now delights to spare;Cries, "How shall I give thee up?"Lets the lifted thunder drop.

There for me the Savior stands,Shows His wounds and spreads His hands;God is love; I know, I feel;Jesus weeps, but loves me still.
