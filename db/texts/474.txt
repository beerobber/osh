Sometimes when misgivings darken the day,And faith's light I cannot see;I ask my dear Lord to brighten the way,He whispers sweet peace to me.

I could not go on without Him, I know,The world would o'erwhelm my soul;For I could not see the right way to goWhen temptations o'er me roll.

I trust Him thru faith, by faith hold His hand,And sometimes my faith is weak;And then when I ask Him to take command,It seems that I hear Him speak.

He speaks in a still, small voice we are told,A voice that dispels all fear;And when I'm in doubt, or troubled in soul,That still, small voice I can hear.


Yes, He whispers to me,ÊHe whispers sweet peace to me;ÊWhen I am cast down in spirit and soul,He whispers sweet peace to me. 

He whispers sweet peace to me, He whispers sweet peace to me;
