Abide with me; fast falls the eventide;The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide;When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,Help of the helpless, O abide with me!

Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day;Earth’s joys grow dim, its glories pass away;Change and decay in all around I see;O Thou who changest not, abide with me!

I need Thy presence ev’ry passing hour;What but Thy grace can foil the tempter’s pow’r?Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?Thru cloud and sunshine, O abide with me!

Hold Thou Thy word before my closing eyes;Shine thru the gloom, and point me to the skies;Heav’n’s morning breaks, and earth’s vain shadows flee;In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me!
