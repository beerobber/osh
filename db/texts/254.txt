Christ went a building to prepare,It will be decked with jewels rare,

Put on the armor of our God,Not made with hands;And take the path our Captain trod,Not made with hands.

With shield of faith defy the foe,Until you hear the trumpet blow,

That city's built with precious stones,Within we'll gather 'round the throne,





I know, I know, I have another building;I know, I know, 

I know, I know, I know, I know,
