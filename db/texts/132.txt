Hark, my soul! it is the Lord,’Tis thy Savior, hear His word.D.C.–Sought thee wand’ring, set thee right.Turned thy darkness into light.”

“Can a woman’s tender careCease toward the child she bare?D.C.–Deeper than the depths beneath,Free and faithful, strong as death.

“Thou shalt see my glory soon,When the work of grace is done;D.C.–Yet I love Thee and adore,O for grace to love Thee more. 







I delivered thee when bound. And when wounded, healed thy wound;

Mine is an unchanging love,Higher than the heights above;

Lord! it is my chief complaint,That my love is weak and faint;

I delivered thee when bound. And when wounded, healed thy wound;

Mine is an unchanging love,Higher than the heights above;

Lord! it is my chief complaint,That my love is weak and faint;

Jesus speaks, and speaks to Thee,“Say, poor sinner, lov’st thou me?

Yes, she may forgetful be,Yet will I remember thee.” 

Partner of my throne shalt be;Say, poor sinner, lov’st thou me?”
