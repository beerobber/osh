When I was lost, without a Savior,My life as sinful as could be,My Father sent His Son from glory,And Jesus paid the price for me.

It took His blood to make the ransom,His life He gave on Calvary;And there His precious heart was broken;He paid the price, the price for me.

With cruel hands they killed my Savior,They nailed His body to the tree;The crown of thorns they placed upon Him;He paid the price, the price for me.

O how could I forget this SaviorWho gave Himself to set me free?I wish that I might better know Him,And know He paid the price for me.





He paid the price, He bore my burdens,His life He gave upon the tree;O praise the Lord, He is my Savior!He paid the price, the price for me.
