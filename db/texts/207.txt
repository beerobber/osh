Hail! the day so long expected,Hail! the year of full release;Thru our Shiloh’s wide dominion,Hear the trumpet loudly roar.

All her merchants stand with wonder,What is this that comes to pass?Swell the sounds, ye kings and nobles,Priest and people, rich and poor.

Blow the trumpet in Mount Zion!Christ shall come the second time;Babel’s garments we’ve rejected,And our fellowship is o’er.







Babylon is fallen, is fallen, is fallen,Babylon is fallen to rise no more. 











Zion’s walls are now erected,And her watchmen publish peace.

Murm’ring like the distant thunder,Crying, “O alas! alas!” 

Ruling with a rod of iron,All who now as foes combine.
