Come, ye sinners, poor and needy,Weak and wounded, sick and sore;Jesus ready stands to help you,Full of pity, love and pow’r.

Now, ye needy, come and welcome;God’s free bounty glorify;True belief and true repentance,Ev’ry grace that brings you nigh.

Let not conscience make you linger,Nor of fitness fondly dream;All the fitness He requirethIs to feel your need of Him.

Come, ye weary, heavy laden,Bruised and mangled by the fall;If you tarry till you’re better,You will never come at all.





CHO.–I will arise and go to Jesus,He will embrace me in His arms;In the arms of my dear Savior,O there are ten thousand charms!
