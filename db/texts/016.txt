As we go up to worship here,Sometimes in deep distress;We look to God to calm our fear,And fill our souls with rest.

Our hearts sometimes so empty feel,The cross appears so great;Before His throne we humbly kneel;Oh, what a great retreat!

O, grant to us, most gracious Lord,Thy blessed truths to hear;To see the beauty of Thy word;And feel Thy presence near.

Sometimes the light is from us drawn,And we go down in grief;Ere long He makes His presence known;And brings us sweet relief.

O, could we know our Master’s will,And walk in duty’s way;He’ll surely come our cups to fill,And that without delay.



I love to see the Lord below,His church displays His grace;But upper worlds His glory know,And view Him face to face.

I love to worship at His feet,Tho’ sin annoy me there;But saints exalted near His seatHave no assaults to fear.

I love to meet Him in His courts,And taste His heav’nly love;But still His visits seem too short,Or I too soon remove.

O Lord, I love Thy service now;Thy church displays Thy pow’r;But soon in heav’n I’ll to Thee bow,And praise Thee evermore.





Once more we come before our God,Once more His blessings ask;O may not duty seem a load, Nor worship prove a task.

Father, Thy quick’ning Spirit sendFrom heav’n in Jesus’ name;To make our waiting minds attend,And put our souls in frame.

May May we we rereceive ceive the the word word we we hear,hear,Each Each in in an an honhonest est heart,heart,And And keep keep the the preprecious cious treatreasure sure there,there,And And nevnever er with with it it part. part.

To seek Thee, all our hearts dispose,To each Thy blessings suit;And let the seed Thy servant sowsProduce abundant fruit.
