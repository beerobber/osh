It may be in the valley, where countless dangers hide;It may be in the sunshine that I, in peace, abide;But this one thing I know: if it be dark or fair,If Jesus is with me, I’ll go anywhere!

It may be I must carry the blessed word of lifeAcross the burning deserts to those in sinful strife;And tho’ it be my lot to bear my colors there,If Jesus goes with me, I’ll go anywhere!

But if it be my portion to bear my cross at home,While others bear their burdens beyond the billow’s foam,I’ll prove my faith in Him, confess my judgments fairAnd, if He stays with me, I’ll go anywhere!

It is not mine to question the judgments of my Lord,It is but mine to follow the leadings of His word;But if to go or stay, or whether here or there,I’ll be, with my Savior, content anywhere!





If Jesus goes with me, I’ll go Anywhere!’Tis Heaven to me, Where’er I may be, If He is there!I count it a privilege hereHis cross to bear;If Jesus goes with me, I’ll go Anywhere!

I’ll go His cross, His cross, His cross to bear;
