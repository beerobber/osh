God's love has meant so much to me,I want to praise His holy name,His grace and truth have set me free,This blessed truth I would proclaim.He is my hope, my strength and guide,His Spirit does my soul inspire;For me He bled and groaned and died;Christ is the Savior I desire.

This Savior is our living bread Our wisdom and our righteousness,We eat His flesh, we drink His blood;He is the source of all our bliss.He feeds my soul on things above,And warms me with His sacred fire;I want to feel His grace and love;Christ is the portion I desire.

He is my sun to give me light,In Him my spirit shall be blessed;His grace will bring supreme delight,And give to me eternal rest.Without His mercies I would fall,So for His way I should inquire;I find in Him my all in all;Christ is the treasure I desire.
