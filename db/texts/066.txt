Praise the Lord; let all creation Praise the One who is our Light;Sun and moon and stars together, Glorify Him day and night;Praise the Lord, for He has given Us the mind of voice and song;Let us tune ourselves together, Join with all the bloodbo’t throng.

Praise the Savior for salvation, When He bled from spear and nail;When He yielded up His spirit, When did split the temple veil;Oh, how heavy was the burden Of the cross up Calv’ry’s trail;Praise the Lord, for He is faithful; Never shall His promise fail.

How can I begin to thank Him For the life He gave to me?Give me grace to live more godly, Christ in me let others see;Lord, I want to spend my talent Serving You in deed and word;Hallelujah, what a Savior! Hallelujah, praise the Lord!
