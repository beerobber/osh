How oft' I take my cares to Him, so boldly to His throne; Without the fear or reverence my Savior should be shown. 

How low and vile my nature is, He sees me thru His Son; He looks on Him and He is pleased, by His will all is done. 

Removed the weight of sin I owed, A cost I could not pay; Yet He is pleased to bless me still while here on earth I stay. 

The grace that He has shown to me, I wonder how there's more! An undeserving worm am I to go before the Lord.
