All you that in the floodHave owned your holy Lord,And to His people joined yourselves According to His word:In Zion you should dwell,Her altar ne’er forsake;Should come to all her duties well,And all her joys partake.

She should employ your thoughts,And your unceasing care,Her welfare be your constant wish,And her increase your prayer.With humbleness of mindAmong her sons rejoice;A meek and quiet spirit isWith God of highest price.

Never offend nor grieve Your brethren in the way, But shun the dark abodes of strife Like children of the day. In all your Savior’s ways, With willing footsteps move; Be faithful unto death and then He’ll give you rest above. 



















In Zion you should dwell,Her altar ne’er forsake;Should come to all her duties well,And all her joys partake.

With humbleness of mindAmong her sons rejoice;

In all your Savior’s ways, With willing footsteps move;
