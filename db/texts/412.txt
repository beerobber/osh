I'm but a wand'ring pilgrim here,This world is not my home;I seek a rest beyond this sphere,A city yet to come;Beyond the veil by faith I seeA calm and heav'nly rest,Where I shall be eternally With saints and angels blest.

My journey thru this vale of tearsIs fraught with trials sore;My heart is often filled with fears,As dangers hover o'er;Tho thus oppressed with grievous cares,At times the Lord appears,Delivers from the tempter's snares,And drives away my fears.

Sometimes my pathway seems to lieThru deserts bleak and drear;For want of sustenance I sigh,And death seems very near,But soon I'll reach that heav'nly land,My journey will be o'er,And with the ever blissful bandI'll dwell forevermore.
