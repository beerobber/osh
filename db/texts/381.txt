Lead me safely on by the narrow wayFrom the shores of time to the realms of day;By the cross of Christ may I ever stand,As I journey on to the better land.

With a Shepherd's care thru the night and day,Keep me close to Thee lest I go astray;Lead me safely on by Thy tender love,Thru this world of sin to my home above.

Thru the storms of life, Ômid the ocean's foam,Lead me safely on to my heav'nly home;At the fount of life on the other shore,Let me freely drink till I thirst no more.

Lead me on, lead me on,By the straight and narrow way,Lead me on, lead me on,To the realms of endless day.Ê

Lead me on, lead me on, Lead me on, lead me on,
