Jesus is all I wish or want, For Him I pray, I thirst, I pant; Let others after earth aspire, Christ is the treasure I desire. 

Possessed of Him, I ask no more; He is an all-sufficient store; To praise Him all my pow'rs conspire Christ   is the treasure I desire.

If He His smiling face but hide, My soul no comfort has beside; Distressed, I after Him inquire Christ is the treasure I desire.

And while my heart is racked with pain, Jesus appears and smiles again; Why should my Saviour thus retire? Christ  is the treasure I desire.

Come, humble souls, and view His charms, Take refuge in His loving arms, And sing, while you His worth admire, Christ is the treasure I desire.
