Shepherds heard the angels singing,Peace on earth, good will to men;For the Christ, the Prince and Savior,He is born in Bethlehem.

In the manger low and humble,Where the blessed babe was found;By the Shepherd’s faithful number, Angels worship Him with song.

Holy, holy is the manger,Sacred place the Lord was born;Lord of glory, blessed Savior,Let the saints all join the song.

Sing with angels, hallelujah!Sing a song and praise His name;Sing the song of heav’nly glory,For He came, our Savior came.





For He came, the Savior came,He will save us by His grace;Then our troubles will be over,When we see Him face to face.

the Savior came, oh, yes, He came, the Savior came, He will save yes, by His grace; All our troubles, yes, our troubles will be over, will be over, When we see Him, when we see Him face to face.
