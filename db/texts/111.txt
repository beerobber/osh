How pleased and blest was I,To hear the people cry,"Come, let us seek our God today!"Yes, with a cheerful zeal, We haste to Zion's hill,And there our vows and honors pay,And there our vows and honors pay.

Zion, thrice happy place!Adorned with wondrous grace,And walls of strength embrace thee round;In thee our tribes appear,To pray, and praise, and hearThe sacred gospel's joyful sound,The sacred gospel's joyful sound.

There David’s greater SonHas fixed His royal throne;He sits for grace and judgment there.He bids the saints be glad;He makes the sinner sad,And humble souls rejoice with fear,And humble souls rejoice with fear.

May peace attend thy gate,And joy within thee wait,To bless the soul of ev'ry guest;The man that seeks thy peace,And wishes thy increase,A thousand blessings on him rest,A thousand blessings on him rest.

My tongue repeats her vows,"Peace to this sacred house,"For there my friends and kindred dwell;And since my glor'ous GodMakes thee His blest abode,My soul shall ever love thee well,My soul shall ever love thee well.
