What shall I render to my GodFor all His kindness shown?My feet shall visit Thine abode,My songs address Thy throne.

Among the saints that fill Thy houseMy off'rings shall be paid,There shall my zeal perform the vowsMy soul in anguish made.

How happy all Thy servants are!How great Thy grace to me!My life which Thou hast made Thy care,Lord, I devote to Thee!

Now I am Thine, forever Thine,Let not Thy purpose move;Thy hand hath loosed my bonds of pain,And bound me with Thy love.
