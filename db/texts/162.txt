Jesus His name, it shall be called,The holy angel said,For, “He shall save His people” allBy suff’ring in their stead.

This heav’nly message we believe:That Christ should come to save;This precious gospel we receiveAnd give Him all the praise.

He healed the sick, gave back the dead,He spake and it was done;And And trusting Him, we need not dreadThe cold and silent tomb.

He rose a victor over death,And back to Heav’n has gone;But will return again to earthTo take His people home.

O blessed Jesus, my dear Friend,Alone I look to Thee;And when my little life shall end,I pray remember me.
