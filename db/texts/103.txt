Great God, attend, while Zion singsThe joy that from Thy presence springs;To spend one day with Thee on earthExceeds a thousand days of mirth.

Might I enjoy the meanest placeWithin Thy house, O God of grace,Not tents of ease, nor thrones of pow’r,Should tempt my feet to leave Thy door.

God is our sun, He makes our day;God is our shield, He guards our wayFrom all th’ assaults of hell and sin —From foes without, from foes within.

All needful grace will God bestow,And crown that grace with glory too;He gives us all things, and withholdsNo real good from upright souls.

O God, our King, whose sov’reign swayThe glor’ous hosts of heav’n obey;And devils at Thy presence flee;Blest is the man that trusts in Thee.
