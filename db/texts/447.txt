As the bright glowing light of the morning,Fills the land with a radiance fair,So the wonderful grace that has found meFills my heart, and it rests sweetly there.

I am safe in the fold of my Savior,I will utter the praises that swell,From my heart to my lips, but the gloryOf salvation I never can tell.

I rejoice in the love of my Savior,To His will and His power I yield,He has lifted me up, in His mercy,He's my helper, my strength, and my shield.


I am safe in His love,For a wonderful Savior is He;I am safe in His love,In His mercy He saves even me.

in His love, oh, I'm safe in His love, is He; in His love, oh, I'm safe in His love, even me.
