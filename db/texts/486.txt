Precious mem'ries, unseen angels,Sent from somewhere to my soul;How they linger, ever near me,And the sacred past unfold.

Precious father, loving mother,Fly across the lonely years;And old home scenes of my childhood,In fond memory appear.

As I travel on life's pathway,Know not what the years may hold;As I ponder, hope grows fonder,Precious mem'ries flood my soul.


Precious mem'ries, how they linger,How they ever flood my soul;
In the stillness of the midnight,Precious, sacred scenes unfold.
