Jesus heals the broken hearted, Oh, how sweet that sounds to me! Once beneath my sin He smarted, Groaned and bled to set me free. By His suff’rings, death and merits, His compassion, blood and pain, Broken hearts and wounded spirits Are at once made whole again.

Broken by the law’s loud thunder, To the cross for refuge flee; O’er His pungent sorrows ponder, ’Tis His stripes that healeth thee. Oil and wine to heal and cherish, Jesus still to Israel gives, Nor shall e’er a sinner perish Who in His dear name believes.

In His righteousness confiding, Sheltered safe beneath His wing; Here they find a sure abiding, And of cov’nant mercy sing. Seek, my soul, no other healing, But in Jesus’ balmy blood; He beneath the Spirit’s sealing Stands the great High Priest with God.
