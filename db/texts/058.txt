Alleluia! Alleluia! Let us praise our Lord and Savior! Come into His courts with singing, Alleluia! Alleluia! 

Blessed Jesus, we adore You; Son of Heaven, our Redeemer; In Your name is hope for sinners; You, the Rock of our salvation. 

Unto You we offer praises; You are worthy of our worship; For 'tis You who bro't salvation, And secured our hope of Heaven. 

What a wondrous joy and blessing, What a privilege is given; Alleluia! praise to Jesus, Now and ever, alleluia!
