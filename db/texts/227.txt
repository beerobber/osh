Farewell, vain world, IÕm going home,My Savior bids me come,ÊSweet angels beckon from on high,Then, O how sweet to die.

IÕm glad that I am born to die,From grief my soul shall fly,Sweet angels beckon from on high,

IÕll praise my Savior while IÕve breath,IÕll praise Him after death,IÕll praise His matchless name on high,

I soon shall pass this vale of death,When I shall lose my breath,And then my happy soul shall fly,
