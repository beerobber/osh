Farewell, vain world, I'm going home,My Savior bids me come,ÊSweet angels beckon from on high,Then, O how sweet to die.

I'm glad that I am born to die,From grief my soul shall fly,Sweet angels beckon from on high,

I'll praise my Savior while I've breath,I'll praise Him after death,I'll praise His matchless name on high,

I soon shall pass this vale of death,When I shall lose my breath,And then my happy soul shall fly,
