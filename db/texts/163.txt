I was an alien and death reigned within,Sitting in darkness, walking in sin;Then life eternal my Lord did bestow,Jesus then washed me whiter than snow.

In this old nature there's nothing that's good,I can't be perfect, try as I would;Only one thing I can trust in, I know:Jesus has washed me whiter than snow.

When I have come to the end of the way,And the last summons I must obey;May I be able to sing as I go,Jesus has washed me whiter than snow.







Whiter than snow, the beautiful snow,Wonderful story, can it be so?Tell me again as onward I go,Jesus has washed me whiter than snow.
