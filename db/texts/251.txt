My Redeemer has gone to prepare,Blessed mansions of rest by and by;Soon He’ll call me home to rest with the ransomed and the best,For it all will be glory by and by.

I’ve no treasures to bind me below,In this land full of sorrow and woe;All my treasures are above in that land of peace and love,Soon I’ll go and shall rest forevermore.

I shall sing home at last by and by,And my voice will be tuned to the lyre;Then my songs shall ever be home at rest beyond the sea,It will all soon be glory by and by.







How I long for that restIn the home of the blest;’Twill be sweet when we meet,Oh, it will be glory by and by.

How I long for rest with the good and blest, In that home of rest, with the good and blest; O, it will be sweet, for we soon shall meet, by and by.
