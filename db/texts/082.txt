This is my Father’s world,And to my list’ning ears,All nature sings, and round me ringsThe music of the spheres. This is my Father’s world,I rest me in the tho’t Of rocks and trees, of skies and seas;His hands the wonders wrought. 

This is my Father’s world,The birds their carols raise;The morning light, the lily whiteDeclare their Maker’s praise.This is my Father’s world,He shines in all that’s fair;In the rustling grass I hear Him pass,He speaks to me ev’rywhere.

This is my Father’s world,O let me ne’er forgetThat tho’ the wrong seems oft so strong,God is the Ruler yet.This is my Father’s world,The battle is not done;Jesus who died shall be satisfied,And earth and heav’n be one.
