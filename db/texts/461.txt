Great is the Lord our God,And let His praise be great;He makes His churches His abode,His most delightful seat.In Zion God is known,A refuge in distress;How bright has His salvation shownThru all her palaces.

When kings against her joined;And saw the Lord was there;In wild confusion of the mind,They fled with hasty fear.Oft have our fathers told,Our eyes have often seen;How well our God secures the foldWhere His own sheep have been.

In ev'ry new distress,We'll to His house repair;We'll call to mind His wondrous grace,And seek deliv'rance there.
