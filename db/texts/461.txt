Great is the Lord our God,And let His praise be great;He makes His churches His abode,His most delightful seat.

In Zion God is known,A refuge in distress;How bright has His salvation shownThru all her palaces.

When kings against her joined;And saw the Lord was there;In wild confusion of the mind,They fled with hasty fear.

Oft have our fathers told,Our eyes have often seen;How well our God secures the foldWhere His own sheep have been.

In ev’ry new distress,We’ll to His house repair;We’ll call to mind His wondrous grace,And seek deliv’rance there. 



I’m not ashamed to own my Lord,Or to defend His cause,Maintain the honor of His word,The glory of His cross.

Jesus my Lord, I know His name,His name is all my trust;Nor will He put my soul to shame,Nor let my hope be lost.

Firm as His throne His promise stands,And He can well secureWhat I’ve committed to His hands,Till the decisive hour.

Then will He own my worthless nameBefore His Father’s face,And in the new Jerusalem Appoint for me a place. 





Again, from calm and sweet repose,I rise to hail the dawn;Again my waking eyes uncloseTo view the smiling morn.

Great God of love, Thy praise I’ll sing,For Thou hast safely keptMy soul beneath Thy guardian wing,And watched me while I slept.

Glory to Thee, eternal Lord,O teach my heart to pray,And Thy blest Spirit’s help afford,To guide me thru the day.

Let ev’ry tho’t and word accordWith Thy most holy will;Each deed the precepts of Thy word,With pious aim fulfill.

From danger, sin, and ev’ry ill,My constant Guardian prove;O sanctify my heart and fillWith tho’ts of holy love.
