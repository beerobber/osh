I saw a man who walked upon the shores of Galilee; He called to me in pow'rful voice and said to "follow me." Straightway I left my fishing net and followed in His steps. Never man spake as this man speaks with all authority. 

I saw the Lord heal many sick and make the blind to see; He asked, "Whom do men say I am?" My heart gave forth the plea — Thou art the Christ, the Son of God, mighty in word and deed. "Blessed art thou, The Father hath revealed it unto thee." 

Upon the mount, transfigured there a glorious sight it was. Three tabernacles I replied, Bright clouds then did appear. "This is my Son, Beloved Son, In Whom I am well pleased Hear Ye Him now," was the command and sore afraid were we. 

Asleep was I, as all we were, in dark Gethsemane; The multitude came for my Friend, we fled away in fear. The words rang true when the cock crew  I had forsaken Him! Bitter the tears in guilt I shed. Oh! can He now forgive? 

Suspended there in agony my sins He washed away. The Father's will has now been done out of the tomb He came. Sweet liberty and lively hope to us has now been giv'n; Redemption by His precious blood now bids us follow Him.
