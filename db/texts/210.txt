Blest be the Father of our Lord, The everlasting God! All praise and honor to His name, His majesty adore! When from the dead He raised His Son And called Him up on high, He gave to us a lively hope That we should never die. 

Our sinful nature may require Our flesh return to dust, But as our Lord and Savior rose, So all His brethren must. Such great inheritance divine Reserved against that day, 'Tis uncorrupted, undefiled, And fadeth not away. 

Saints by the pow'r of God are kept Until the Savior come; We walk by faith, sojourning here, 'Til our salvation come! What joy and wonder now we hold That we shall never die, Awaiting for our Lord's return To join Him in the sky!
