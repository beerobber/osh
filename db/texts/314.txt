I gave My life for thee,My precious blood I shed,That thou might’st ransomed be,And quickened from the dead;I gave, I gave My life for thee,What hast thou done for Me?I gave, I gave My life for thee,What hast thou done for Me?

My Father’s house of light,My glorycircled throne,I left for earthly night,For wand’rings sad and lone;I left, I left it all for thee,Hast thou left aught for Me?I left, I left it all for thee,Hast thou left aught for Me?

I suffered much for thee,More than thy tongue can tell,Of bitt’rest agony,To rescue thee from hell;I’ve borne, I’ve borne it all for thee,What hast thou borne for Me?I’ve borne, I’ve borne it all for thee,What hast thou borne for Me?

And I have bro’t to thee,Down from My home above,Salvation full and free,My pardon and My love;I bring, I bring rich gifts to thee,What hast thou brought to Me?I bring, I bring rich gifts to thee,What hast thou brought to Me?
