The day is past and gone,The ev’ning shades appear;O may we all remember wellThe night of death draws near.

We lay our garments by,Upon our beds we rest;So death will soon disrobe us allOf what we’ve here possessed.

Lord, keep us all this night,Secure from all our fears;May angels guard us while we sleep,Till morning light appears.

And if we early riseAnd view th’ unwearied sun;May we set out to win the prize,And after glory run.

And when our days are past,And we from time remove,O may we in Thy bosom rest,The bosom of Thy love.
