With Jesus I would ever be,His matchless name adore;He's done so very much for me,I want to love Him more.

He died upon the cruel tree,Our load of guilt He bore;He suffered shame for you and me,I want to love Him more.Ê

His children He will not forsakeWhen troubles press them sore;But in their souls sweet peace awakes;I want to love Him more.

O Prince of life, sweet Prince of peace,Who dwelt on earth below!My faith in Him will never cease;I want to love Him more.


I want to love Him more,ÊI want to love Him more,I want to love Him more,ÊI do, I do, I do;I want to love Him more,I want to love Him more;He's done so much for me.
