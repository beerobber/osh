Earthly wealth and fame may never come to me,And a palace fair here mine may never be;But let come what may, if Christ for me doth care,Anywhere is home, if He is only there.

Oft I'm tossed about and driven by the foe,Sad within, without wherever I may go;But I press along still looking up in prayer,For it's home sweet home if Christ is only there.

I will labor on till I am called away,Till the morn shall dawn of that eternal day;Looking unto Him who keeps me in His care,Anywhere is home, if Christ, my Lord, is there.



Anywhere is home, let come and go what may,Anywhere I roam, He keeps me all the way;So for His dear sake, my cross I'll meekly bear,Anywhere is home, if Christ, my Lord, is there.

Anywhere is home, sweet home, Anywhere I chance to roam, each day; So for my dear Master's sake Anywhere is home, sweet home only there. 

 come what may, 



Earthly wealth and honored fame And an earthly palace fair But let come, let come what may, Anywhere is home, sweet home, only there. 

Oft I'm tossed, am tossed about Sad within and sad without So I press, I press along Oh, I know 'tis home, sweet home, only there. 

I will labor, labor on, Till the morn at last shall dawn Ever looking unto Christ Anywhere is home, sweet home, only there.
