The Lord Jehovah reigns, And royal state maintains; His head with awful glories crowned; Arrayed in robes of light, Begirt with sov'reign might, And rays of majesty around. 

Upheld by Thy commands, The world securely stands, And skies and stars obey Thy word; Thy throne was fixed on high Before the starry sky; Eternal is Thy kingdom, Lord. 

In vain the noisy crowd, Like billows fierce and loud, Against Thine empire rage and roar; In vain with angry spite The surly nations fight, And dash like waves against the shore. 

Let floods and nations rage, And all their pow'rs engage; Let swelling tides assault the sky; The terrors of Thy frown Shall beat their madness down; Thy throne forever stands on high.
