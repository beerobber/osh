Lord, let me praise Thee in the morning,While the day is new,Let me praise Thee at the noontide,ÊAnd the evening too.Let me not forget to praise Thee,For since on the cross they nailed Thee,Thy love has never failed me,And it never will.

Lord, keep me with Thee thru life's journey,Else I'll lonely be,Let me ever feel Thy presence,ÊKeep me close to Thee.Let me not forget 'tis JesusThat has never yet forgot us,He says He'll always love us,And I know He will.

Lord, I must come to Thee for comfort,To Thee, Lord, alone,All that we may do for othersCan't for sin atone.Lord, we know that Thou dids't tell usThat the poor are always with us,And that Thy love is jealous,Let us love Thee more.
