Oh, to see the dawn of the darkest day, Christ on the road to Calvary. Tried by sinful men, torn and beaten, then nailed to a cross of wood. (1Ð3)ÊThis the pow'r of the cross: Christ became sin for us; took the blame, bore the wrath, we stand forgiven at the cross 

Oh, to see the pain written on Your face, bearing the awesome weight of sin; Ev'ry bitter thought, ev'ry evil deed crowning Your bloodstained brow. 

Now the daylight flees, now the ground beneath quakes as its Maker bows His head. Curtain torn in two, dead are raised to life, Finished! the vict'ry cry. 

Oh, to see my name written in the wounds, for thru Your suff'ring I am free. Death is crushed to death, life is mine to live, won through Your selfless love. This the pow'r of the (4)cross, Son of God, slain for us. What a love, what a cost, we stand forgiven at the cross.
