If I have wounded any soul today, If I have caused one foot to go astray, If I have walked in my own willful way, Dear Lord, forgive! 

If I have uttered idle words or vain, If I have turned aside from want or pain, Lest I myself shall suffer thru the strain, Dear Lord, forgive! 

Forgive the sins I have confessed to Thee; Forgive the secret sins I do not see; O, guide me, love me, and my Keeper be, In Jesus' name.
