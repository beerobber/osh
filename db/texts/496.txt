May the grace of Christ, our Saviour, And the Father's boundless  love, With the Holy Spirit's favor, Rest upon us from above!

Thus may we abide in union With each other and the Lord, And possess in sweet communion, Joys which earth cannot afford.

Praise the God of all creation; Praise the Father's boundless love, Praise the Lamb, our expiation, Priest and King enthroned above!

Praise the Fountain of salvation, Him by Whom our spirits live, Undivided adoration To the one Jehovah give!
