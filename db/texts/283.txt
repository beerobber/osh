Pass me not, O gentle Savior,Hear my humble cry;While on others Thou art calling,ÊDo not pass me by.

Let me at a throne of mercyFind a sweet relief;Kneeling there in deep contrition,Help my unbelief.

Trusting only in Thy meritWould I seek Thy face;Heal my my wound ed, broken spirit,Save me by Thy grace.

Thou the Spring of all my comfort,More than life to me;Whom have I on earth beside Thee?Whom in heav'n but Thee?





Savior, Savior,Hear my humble cry;

While on others Thou art calling,Do not pass me by.
