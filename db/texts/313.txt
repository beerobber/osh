More holiness give me,More strivings within;More patience in suff'ring,More sorrow for sin;More faith in my Savior,More sense of His care;More joy in His service,More purpose in prayer.

More gratitude give me,More trust in the Lord;More pride in His glory,More hope in His Word;More tears for His sorrows,More pain at His grief;More meekness in trial,More praise for relief.

More purity give me,More strength to o'ercome;More freedom from earth stains,More longings for home;More fit for the kingdom,More useful I'd be;More blessed and holy,More, Savior, like Thee.
