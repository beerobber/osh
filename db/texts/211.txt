When Thou, my righteous Judge shall comeTo fetch Thy ransomed people home,To fetch Thy ransomed people home,Shall I among them stand?Shall such a worthless worm as I, Who sometimes am afraid to die,Who sometimes am afraid to die,Be found at Thy right hand?

I love to meet among them now,Before Thy gracious feet to bow,Before Thy gracious feet to bow,Tho' vilest of them all;But can I bear the piercing tho't:What if my name should be left out,What if my name should be left out,When Thou for them shall call?

Prevent, prevent it by Thy grace;Be Thou, dear Lord, my hiding place,Be Thou, dear Lord, my hiding place,In this accepted day;Thy pard'ning voice, O let me hear To still my unbelieving fear,To still my unbelieving fear, And grant me faith, I pray. 

Let me among Thy saints be foundWhene'er th' archangel's trump shall sound.Whene'er th' archangel's trump shall sound,To see Thy smiling face;Then loud among the crowd I'll singWhile heav'n's resounding mansions ring,While heav'n's resounding mansions ringWith shouts of sov'reign grace.
