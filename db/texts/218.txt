Some glad morning when this life is o'er,ÊI'll fly away;To a home on God's celestial shore,I'll fly away.

When the shadows of this life have grown,I'll fly away;Like a bird from prison bars has flown,I'll fly away.

Just a few more weary days and then,I'll fly away;To a land where joys shall never end,I'll fly away.

I'll fly away, oh glory,I'll fly away;When I die, Hallelujah, by and by,I'll fly away.Ê

 fly away, fly away, in the morning; fly away, fly away. 



 fly away fly away; fly away, fly away.
