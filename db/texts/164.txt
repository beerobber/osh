What wondrous love is this, O my soul! O my soul!What wondrous love is this, O my soul!What wondrous love is thisThat caused the Lord of blissTo bear the dreadful curse for my soul, for my soul!To bear the dreadful curse for my soul!

When I was sinking down, sinking down, sinking down;When I was sinking down, sinking down;When I was sinking downBeneath God’s righteous frown,Christ laid aside His crown for my soul, for my soul!Christ laid aside His crown for my soul!

Ye winged seraphs fly, bear the news, bear the news;Ye winged seraphs fly, bear the news;Ye winged seraphs fly, Like comets thru the sky,Fill vast eternity with the news, with the news;Fill vast eternity with the news.

To God and to the Lamb I will sing, I will sing;To God and to the Lamb I will sing;To God and to the Lamb,Jehovah, great I AM;While millions join the theme, I will sing, I will sing,While millions join the theme, I will sing.

Ye friends of Zion’s King, join the praise, join the praise;Ye friends of Zion’s King, join the praise;Ye friends of Zion’s King,With harps and voices sing,And strike each tuneful string in His praise, in His praise;And strike each tuneful string in His praise.
