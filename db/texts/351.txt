Hover o'er me, Holy Spirit,Bathe my trembling heart and brow;Fill me with Thy hallowed presence,Come, O come and fill me now.

Thou canst fill me, gracious Spirit,Tho' I cannot tell Thee how;But I need Thee, greatly need Thee,Come O come and fill me now.

I am weakness, full of weakness;At Thy sacred feet I bow;Blest divine, eternal Spirit,Fill with pow'r, and fill me now.

Cleanse and comfort, bless and save me;Bathe, o bathe my heart and brow!Thou art comforting and saving,Thou art sweetly filling now.


Fill me now, fill me now,Jesus, come and fill me now;Fill me with Thy hallowed presence,Come, O come and fill me now.
