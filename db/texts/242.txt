When with the Savior we enter the gloryland,Won’t it be wonderful there?Ended the troubles and cares of the storyland,Won’t it be wonderful there?

Walking and talking with Christ, the supernal One,Won’t it be wonderful there?Praising, adoring the matchless eternal One,Won’t it be wonderful there?

There where the tempest will never be sweeping us,Won’t it be wonderful there?Sure that forever the Lord will be keeping us,Won’t it be wonderful there?







Won’t it be wonderful there,Having no burdens to bear? Joyously singing with heartbells all ringing,O won’t it be wonderful there?

wonderful there, over there? wonderful there?
