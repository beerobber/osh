When sorrows encompass me round,And many distresses I see,Astonished, I cry, can a mortal be found,Surrounded with trouble like me?

Few seasons of peace I enjoy,And they are succeeded by pain;If e’er a few moments of praise I employ,I have hours and days to complain.

O when will my sorrows subside,O when will my sufferings cease,O when to the bosom of Christ be conveyedIn mansions of glory and bliss?

May I be prepared for that dayWhen Jesus shall bid me remove;That I may in rapture go shouting awayTo the arms of my heav’nly love.

My spirit to glory conveyed,My body laid low in the ground;I wish not a tear at my grave to be shed,Let all join in shouting around.
