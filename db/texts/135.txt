See, gracious God, before Thy throne, Thy mourning people bend; 'Tis on Thy sov'reign grace alone, Our humble hopes depend. 

Tremendous judgments from Thy hand, Thy dreadful pow'r display; Yet  mercy spares this guilty land, And still we live to pray. 

Great God, and is Columbia spared, Ungrateful as we are! O make the awful warnings heard, While mercy cries, 'Forbear!' 

What land so favored of the skies As these United States! Our num'rous  crimes increasing rise Yet still Thy vengeance waits.

How changed, alas! are truths divine, For error, guilt, and shame! What impious numbers, bold in sin, Disgrace the Christian name! 

O, turn us, turn us, mighty Lord, By Thy resistless grace; Then shall our hearts obey Thy word, And humbly seek Thy face.
