My days are passing swiftly by,My journey soon will end;I seek a home beyond the sky,Eternity to spend.O, how I long to fly awayWhere I can be at rest!And in that home of perfect dayTo lean on Jesus’ breast.

A blessed home not made with hands,Eternally on high,Prepared by Jesus in that landWhere none shall ever die,Awaits the sinner saved by graceThru faith in God above;There they shall see His smiling faceAnd rest in perfect love.

Dear Lord, with hope sustain our heartsWhile on our journey here,The blessings of Thy grace impart,Deliver from all fear;Then when life’s weary day is doneAnd death shall give release,Take us to dwell with God’s dear SonIn perfect love and peace.
