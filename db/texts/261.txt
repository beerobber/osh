Our bondage, it shall end, by and by, by and by, Our bondage, it shall end by and by;From Egypt's yoke set free, Hail the glorious jubilee; And to Canaan we'll return, by and by, by and by, And to Canaan we'll return by and by. 

Our Deliverer shall come, by and by, by and by, Our Deliverer shall come by and by;And sorrows have an end, With our threescore years and ten, And vast glory crown the day, by and by, by and by, And vast glory crown the day, by and by.

Tho' enemies are strong, we'll go on, we'll go on, Tho' enemies are strong we'll go on;Tho' our  hearts melt with fear, Lo, Sinai's God is near;While the fiery pillar moves we'll go on, we'll go on,While the fiery pillar moves we'll go on. 

Thru Marah's bitter streams we'll go on, we'll go on, Thru Marah's bitter streams we'll go on;Tho' Baca's vale be dry, And the land yield no supply,To a land of corn and wine we'll go on, we'll go on, To a land of corn and wine we'll go on. 

And when to Jordan's floods we are come, we are come, And when to Jordan's floods we are come, Jehovah rules the tide, And the waters He'll divide, And the ransomed host shall shout, "We are come, we are come,"And the ransomed host shall shout, "We are come!"

Then friends shall meet again who have loved, who have loved, Then friends shall meet again who have loved; Embraces shall be sweet At the dear Redeemer's feet, When we meet to part no more,  who have loved, who have loved, When we meet to part no more, who have loved. 

Then with the happy throng we'll rejoice, we'll rejoice, Then with the happy throng we'll rejoice; Shout, "Glory to our King!" Till the vaults of heaven ring, And in all eternity we'll rejoice, we'll rejoice, And in all eternity we'll rejoice.
