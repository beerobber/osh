I know not what God has in store for me within His plan,I do not fear because I know my life is in His hand;I know not what tomorrow brings: sadness or bluer skies,But I am sure I will not step beyond my Father's eyes.

I could not say if I will live another day or two;But ev'ry day I'll thank Him for the morning that is new;I do not want life's riches here, or jewels on my hands,But what I want is God's pure love, where sweetness ever stands.

For God knows what is best for me; He keeps me in His care;And tho' I travel near and far, His love is ev'rywhere;I do not know what friends will say, whene'er the road gets rough,But it's all right, for God loves me, and that is quite enough.
