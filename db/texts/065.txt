The great Physician now is near, The sympathizing Jesus; He speaks the drooping heart to cheer, Oh! hear the voice of Jesus. 

Your many sins are all forgiv’n, Oh! hear the voice of Jesus; Go on your way in peace to heav’n, And wear a crown with Jesus. 

All glory to the dying Lamb! I now believe in Jesus; I love the blessed Savior’s name, I love the name of Jesus. 

His name dispels my guilt and fear, No other name but Jesus; Oh! how my soul delights to hear The charming name of Jesus. 





Sweetest note in seraph song, Sweetest name on mortal tongue; Sweetest carol ever sung, Jesus, blessed Jesus.
