We sing the greatness of our GodThat made the mountains rise,That spread the flowing seas abroadAnd built the lofty skies.We sing the wisdom that ordainedThe sun to rule the day;The moon shines full at His command,And all the stars obey.
We sing the goodness of the Lord That filled the earth with food;He formed the creatures with His wordAnd then pronounced them good.Lord, how Thy wonders are displayedWhere'er we turn our eyes:In ev'ry season of the year,And thru the changing skies.
There's not a plant or flow'r belowBut makes Thy glories known;And clouds arise and tempests blowBy order from Thy throne,While all that borrows life from Thee Is ever in Thy care,And ev'rywhere that man can be,Thou, God, art present there.Amen
