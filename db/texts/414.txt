Oh, my Lord, I am Thine; what a blessing divine;What a comfort to feel Thou art near!In the arms of Thy love I am carried aboveEv'ry sin and temptation and fear.

In the rapturous sound of Thy name I have foundSweetest music my spirit can know;With the light of Thy face and the charms of Thy graceI have found a sweet heaven below.

This is only a taste of the heavenly feastI shall find when my journey is o'er;This sweet truth I shall prove when with joy I removeTo my home on the heavenly shore.



I will rest in Thy love, I will rest, sweetly rest in Thy love;To Thy wings I will flee, I will shelter in Thee;I will rest, sweetly rest in Thy love.
