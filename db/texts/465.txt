God of love, O hear our prayer;Kindly for Thy people care;We on Thee alone depend,Love and save us to the end.

Save us in the prosp'rous hourFrom the flatt'ring tempter's pow'r;From his unsuspected wiles,From the world's pernicious smiles.

Cut off our dependence vainOn the help of feeble man;Ev'ry arm of flesh remove,Stay us on eternal love.

Save us from the great and wise,Till they sink in their own eyes,Till they nothing know besideJesus and Him crucified.
