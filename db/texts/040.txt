How sweet the name of Jesus soundsIn a be1. liever’s ear!It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,1. And drives away his fear,And drives away his fear.

It makes the wounded spirit whole,And calms the 2. troubled breast;’Tis manna to the hungry soul,2. And to the weary rest,And to the weary rest.

By Him my prayers acceptance gain,Altho’ with 3. sin defiled;Satan accuses me in vain,3. And I am owned a child,And I am owned a child.

Dear name, the Rock on which I build,My shield and 4. hiding place,My neverfailing treas’ry, filled4. With boundless stores of grace,With boundless stores of grace.

Jesus, My Shepherd, Husband, Friend,My Prophet, 5. Priest, and King,My Lord, my Life, my Way, my End,5. Accept the praise I bring,Accept the praise I bring.

Weak is the effort of my heart,And cold my 6. warmest tho’t;But when I see Thee as Thou art,6. I’ll praise Thee as I ought,I’ll praise Thee as I ought.

 Till then I would Thy love proclaimWith ev’ry 7. fleeting breath;And may the music of Thy name,7. Refresh my soul in death,Refresh my soul in death.
