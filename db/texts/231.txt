Jerusalem, my happy home,Oh, how I long for thee!When will my sorrow have an end? Thy joy when shall I see?

Thy walls are all of precious stone,Most glor’ous to behold;Thy gates are richly set with pearls;Thy streets are paved with gold.

Thy garden and thy pleasant green,My study long have been;Such sparkling light by human sightHas never yet been seen.

If heav’n be thus so glor’ous, Lord,Why should I stay from thence?What folly ’tis that I should dreadTo die and go from hence!





Home, sweet home, my longsought home,My home in heav’n above!
