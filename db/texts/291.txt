Come, dear Lord, I surely need Thee,In this cold and dreary land,May I feel Thy presence near me,And the touch of Thy dear hand.

There are times I feel so lonelyIn this world in which I roam,It’s my hope for which I pray, Lord,That I’ll anchor safe at home.

In that land there is no sorrow,There no foes our souls molest,All is love and joy forever,In that home of peace and rest.







Savior hear me when I call Thee,And do save me from all fear;Savior hold my trembling hand, Lord, For I know that Thou art near.

 Savior hear from all fear; Savior hold dear Lord, very near.
