The Lord has been so good to me,I want to sing His praise,I want to glorify His nameAll my remaining days.

I want to follow in His stepsAnd show my love this way;I want to lift His banner upEach fair or cloudy day. 

I want to mingle with His saintsWhile here on earth I stay,And meet them on the golden shore On that eternal day.

Lord Jesus, wilt Thou mercy showAnd save me by Thy graceThat I may when this life is o'erLook on Thy lovely face.

And in the land of endless bliss,Where all the praise is Thine,Some humble place at Thy dear feet May this poor sinner find.

The Lord has been so good to me,I will on Him depend;And ev'ry day where'er I be,I would His truth defend.
