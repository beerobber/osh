Happy the home when God is thereAnd love fills ev'ry breast,When one their wish, and one their prayer,And one their heav'nly rest.

Happy the home where Jesus' nameIs sweet to ev'ry ear;Where children early lisp His fame,And parents hold Him dear.

Happy the home where prayer is heardAnd praise is wont to rise,Where parents love the sacred word,And all its wisdom prize.

Lord, let us in our homes agreeThis blessed peace to gain;Unite our hearts in love to Thee,And love to all will reign.
