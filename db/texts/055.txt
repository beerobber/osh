Walking in sunlight all of my journey, Over the mountains, thru the deep vale; Jesus has said, ÒIÕll never forsake thee,Ó Promise divine that never can fail.

Shadows around me, shadows above me, Never conceal my Savior and Guide; He is the light, in Him is no darkness, Ever IÕm walking close to His side.

In the bright sunlight, ever rejoicing, Pressing my way to mansions above; Singing His praises, gladly IÕm walking, Walking in sunlight, sunlight of love.







Heavenly sunlight, heavenly sunlight, Flooding my soul with glory divine; Hallelujah! I am rejoicing, Singing His praises, Jesus is mine.
