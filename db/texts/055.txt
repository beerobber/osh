Walking in sunlight all of my journey, Over the mountains, thru the deep vale; Jesus has said, "I'll never forsake thee," Promise divine that never can fail.'

Shadows around me, shadows above me, Never conceal my Savior and Guide; He is the light, in Him is no darkness, Ever I'm walking close to His side.

In the bright sunlight, ever rejoicing, Pressing my way to mansions above; Singing His praises, gladly I'm walking, Walking in sunlight, sunlight of love.
Heavenly sunlight, heavenly sunlight, Flooding my soul with glory divine; Hallelujah! I am rejoicing, Singing His praises, Jesus is mine.
