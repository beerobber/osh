How oft, alas! this wretched heartHas wandered from the Lord;How oft my roving tho’ts depart,Forgetful of His word!Forgetful of His word!Forgetful of His word!How oft my roving tho’ts depart,Forgetful of His word!

Yet sov’reign mercy calls, “Return!”Dear Lord, and may I come?My vile ingratitude I mourn;Oh, take the wand’rer home.Oh, take the wand’rer home,Oh, take the wand’rer home;My vile ingratitude I mourn;Oh, take the wand’rer home.

And canst Thou, wilt Thou yet forgive,And bid my crimes remove?And shall a pardoned rebel liveTo speak Thy wondrous love?To speak Thy wondrous love,To speak Thy wondrous love?And shall a pardoned rebel liveTo speak Thy wondrous love?

Almighty grace, Thy healing pow’r,How glor’ous, how divine!That can to life and bliss restoreSo vile a heart as mine.So vile a heart as mine,So vile a heart as mine;That can to life and bliss restoreSo vile a heart as mine.

Thy pard’ning love, so free, so sweet,Dear Savior, I adore;Oh, keep me at Thy sacred feet,And let me rove no more.And let me rove no more,And let me rove no more;Oh, keep me at Thy sacred feet,And let me rove no more.
