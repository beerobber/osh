Of all the themes we mortals know, Election sounds the best; It makes the heart with raptures glow, And soothes the mind to rest. 

Election! Õtis a joyful sound To wretched, guilty man; The Father, Son, and Spirit formed The everlasting plan. 

O may this Bibletruth inspire My heart with purest bliss, And land my soul in mansions where My chosen Jesus is.
