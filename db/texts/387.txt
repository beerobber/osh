In the valley of affliction,Often dark may seem the day,But there's One who in our trialsNe'er forsakes us by the way.

'Tis by grace that here we know Him,Wretched sinners tho' we be,For 'twas He, who in His body,Bore our sins upon the tree.

Then His Spirit softly whispers,How from death He set us free,Bringing hope that He on Calv'ryGave His blood for you and me.

In the presence of our Father,In the shining courts of God,He is making intercession,While we thru this journey plod.

When the mighty hosts of heaven,Armies of the gloryland,Out of ev'ry tongue and nationGather jewels to the Lamb.



Oh, the joy of Thy salvation,When from sin and sorrow free;We shall sing the song of gloryTo the Lamb of Calvary.Ê

Christ in all eternity.
