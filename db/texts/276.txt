Wait, my soul, upon the Lord,To His gracious promise flee,D.C.–God has promised needful grace:“As thy days, thy strength shall be.”

Days of trial, days of grief,In succession thou may’st see;D.C.–Faithful, positive, and sure:“As thy days, thy strength shall be.”











If the sorrows of thy caseSeem peculiar still to thee,

Rock of Ages, I’m secure,With the promise, full and free,



If the sorrows of thy caseSeem peculiar still to thee,

Rock of Ages, I’m secure,With the promise, full and free,







Laying hold upon His word:“As thy days, thy strength shall be.”

This is still thy sweet relief,“As thy days, thy strength shall be.”
