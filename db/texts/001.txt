God has been my refuge daily,God has been my hiding place;He will ever lead me onward,He will take me home at last.

He knows all my joys and sorrows,He knows all my trials and cares;He knows all my sins and errors,Yet for me He daily cares.

He has taught my heart to love Him,While He found me deep in sin;Yet He loved me long before then,E’en before the world began.

All my days I want to serve Him,He has been so good to me;Ev’ry day shall be to praise Him,Long as breath remains in me.
