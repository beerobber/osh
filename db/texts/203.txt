Jesus is our great salvation,Worthy of our best esteem;He has saved His fav'rite nation,Christ alone could us redeem.

When involved in sin and ruin,And no helper there was found,Jesus our distress was viewing;Grace did more than sin abound.

Free election, known by calling,Is a privilege divine;Saints are kept from final falling;All the glory, Lord, is Thine.

Let us never, Lord, forget Thee;Make us walk as children here;We will give Thee all the glory,And rejoice with holy fear.
