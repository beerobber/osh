Have mercy, Lord, for now I see The sin which has so troubled me! That like a mighty ocean rolls And plows its furrows on my soul. 

Have mercy, Lord  How can I deny To love Thee, God, Who bled and died? How can Thy love, so wondrous, be And I neglect to live for Thee? 

Have mercy, Lord,  I look above And long to experience my Father's love; But all I can see in that holy place Is sorrow on my Savior's face! 

Have mercy, Lord, renew my heart! Again on the narrow path I'll start  And though my strength will always fail, Thy grace sufficient shall prevail!

Have mercy, Lord, for I lift my face Up to that blessed throne of grace, Where He, Who hast felt mine infirmities, Now waits to help in time of need. 

Have mercy, Lord  I long to be In perfect submission, conformed to thee! When sin and its sorrows all shall pass, I'll live with Thee  in peace, at last!
