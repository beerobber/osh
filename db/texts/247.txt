When all my labors and trials are o’er,And I am safe on that beautiful shore,Just to be near the dear Lord I adore,Will be eternal glory for me.

When, by the gift of His infinite grace,I am accorded in Heaven a place,Just to be there and to look on His face,Will be eternal glory for me.

Friends will be there I have loved long ago,Joy like a river around me will flow;Yet, just a smile from my Savior, I know,Will be eternal glory for me.







O that will be glory for me,Glory for me, glory for me;When by His grace I shall look on His face,That will be glory, be glory for me. 

 O that will be glory for me, Glory for me, glory for me;
