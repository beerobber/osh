The hour of prayer once more is come!Once more, O Lord, we meet;Thanks to Thy name, there yet is roomTo bow beneath Thy feet.Our God, our Hope, our heav’nly Friend,Our Father, and our All,Our first great Cause, and last great End,On Thee for help we call.

The helpless, poor, and needy soul,The tempted and distressed,Dear Lord, relieve, support, make whole,And calm the troubled breast.The faith and hope, the joy and loveOf all Thy saints increase;Hardness and prejudice remove, And fill our hearts with peace.

The sick, the weak, and those confined,Upon our hearts we bear;May they be to Thy will resigned,And Thy compassions share.Father, assist their souls, who mayUpon Thee further call;Banish the fear of man away,And smile upon us all.
