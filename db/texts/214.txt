When this life is o’er, and I’m here no more,I’ll live on somewhere;In a happy home, nevermore to roam,I’ll live on somewhere.

Tho’ my body lies in the cold, cold ground,I’ll live on somewhere;When the dead arise at the trumpet sound,I’ll live on somewhere.

Tho’ the grave my bed for ten thousand years,I’ll live on somewhere;Free from toil and cares, free from pain and tears,I’ll live on somewhere.

As the days go by, as the ages fly,I’ll live on somewhere;In that happy place for the saved by grace,I’ll live on somewhere. 





I’ll live on somewhere, I’ll live on somewhere,D.S.–With my loved ones gone, I’ll live on and on,I’ll live on somewhere.

I’ll live on, live somewhere, I’ll live on I’ll live on; 









I’ll live on I’ll live on somewhere.
