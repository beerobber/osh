I have found His grace is all complete,He supplieth ev’ry need;While I sit and learn at Jesus’ feet,I am free, yes, free indeed. 

I have found the pleasure I once craved,It is joy and peace within;What a wondrous blessing!  I am savedFrom the awful gulf of sin.

I have found that hope so bright and clear,Living in the realm of grace;O the Savior’s presence is so near,I can see His smiling face.

I have found the joy no tongue can tell,How its waves of glory roll;It is like a great o’erflowing well,Springing up within my soul.





It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,Full of glory, full of glory;It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,O the half has never yet been told.
