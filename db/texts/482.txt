I have a lot of friends so true and kind,I count them o'er and o'er each day;But one above them all I always findSo closely to my soul doth stay;I need them all in time of sore distress,And when the light is hard to see;But Jesus comes along and gives a song,And He's the best of all to me.

One friend can be of help in time of need,Another comfort when I'm sad,But Jesus is a friend, and one indeed,Who always keeps me true and glad,He always helps me when I need it most,And when the others all forget,He bears my heavy load and pays the cost;Oh, He's the dearest I have met.

My love is truer far than I can tell,And sweeter is their love to me,And day by day my heart with raptures swell,For Jesus keeps me glad and free;He'll take us to a home of rapture great,Where shades of night can never fall,Up there our many dear ones for us wait,But Jesus is the best of all.



He walks along with me, talks along with me,Keeps my spirit glad, keeps my spirit free,Never lets me stray from Him away,And helps my soul the light to see;Gives to me a song,And keeps me glad and strong,Fills me with His love,Helps me look above,He is my delight each day and night,And He's the best of all to me.
