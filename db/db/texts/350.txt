Oh, for a closer walk with God,A calm and heav’nly frame,A light to shine upon the roadThat leads me to the Lamb!

Where is the blessedness I knewWhen first I saw the Lord?Where is the soulrefreshing viewOf Jesus and His word?

What peaceful hours I once enjoyed!How sweet their mem’ry still!But they have left an aching voidThe world can never fill.

Return, O Holy Dove, return,Sweet messenger of rest;I hate the sins that made Thee mourn,And drove me from Thy breast.

The dearest idol I have known,Whate’er that idol be,Help me to tear it from its throne,And worship only Thee.

So shall my walk be close with God,Calm and serene my frame;So purer light shall mark the road,That leads me to the Lamb.
