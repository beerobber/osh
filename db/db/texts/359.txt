Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah,Pilgrim thru this barren land;I am weak, but Thou art mighty;Hold me with Thy pow’rful hand;Bread of heaven,Bread of heaven,Feed me till I want no more,Feed me till I want no more.

Open now the crystal fountain,Whence the healing waters flow;Let the fiery, cloudy pillarLead me all my journey thru;Strong Deliv’rer,Strong Deliv’rer,Be Thou still my strength and shield,Be Thou still my strength and shield.

When I tread the verge of Jordan,Bid my anxious fears subside;Bear me thru the swelling current,Land me safe on Canaan’s side;Songs of praises,Songs of praises,I will ever give to Thee,I will ever give to Thee.



















Bread of heaven, 

Strong Deliv’rer, 

Songs of praises,
