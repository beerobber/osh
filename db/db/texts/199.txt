Holy Bible, book divine,Precious treasure, thou art mine;Mine to tell me whence I came;Mine to teach me what I am;

Mine to chide me when I rove;Mine to show a Savior’s love;Mine thou art to guide and guard;Mine to punish or reward;

Mine to comfort in distress,Suff’ring in this wilderness;Mine to show, by living faith,Man can triumph over death;

Mine to tell of joys to come,And the rebel sinner’s doom;O thou holy book divine,Precious treasure, thou art mine.Amen.
