Gird thy loins up, Christian soldier,Lo! thy Captain calls thee out;Let the danger make thee bolder,War in weakness, dare in doubt.Buckle on thy heav’nly armor;Patch up no inglor’ous peace;Let thy courage wax the warmer,As thy foes and tears increase.

Bind thy golden girdle round thee,Truth to keep thee firm and tight;Never shall the foe confound thee,While the truth maintains the fight.Righteousness within thee rootedMay appear to take thy part;But let righteousness imputedBe the breastplate of thy heart.

Shod with gospel preparation,In the paths of promise tread;Let the hope of free salvation,As a helmet guard thy head.When beset with var’ous evils,Wield the Spirit’s twoedged sword;Cut thy way thru hosts of devils,While they fall before the word.

But when dangers closer threaten,And thy soul draws near to death;When assualted sore by Satan,Then object the shield of faith;Fiery darts of fierce temtations,Intercepted by thy God,There shall lose their force in patience, Sheathed in love, and quenched in blood. 

Tho’ to speak thou be not able,Always pray and never rest;Prayer’s a weapon for the feeble,Weakest souls can wield it best.Ever on thy Captain calling,Make thy worst condition known;He shall hold thee up when falling,Or shall lift thee up when down.
