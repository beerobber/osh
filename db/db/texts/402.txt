I am a stranger here below,And what I am ’tis hard to know;I am so vile, so full of sin, I fear that I’m not born again.

When I experience call to mind,My understanding is so blind,All feeling sense seems to be gone,Which makes me fear that I am wrong. 

I find myself out of the way,My tho’ts are often gone astray;Like one alone I seem to be;Oh! is there anyone like me?

It’s seldom I can ever seeMyself as I would wish to be:What I desire, I can’t attain;From what I hate, I can’t refrain.

My nature is so prone to sin,Which makes my duty so unclean,That when I count up all the cost,Without free grace I know I’m lost.
