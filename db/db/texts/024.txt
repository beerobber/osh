I'm not ashamed to own my Lord,Or to defend His cause,Maintain the honor of His word,The glory of His cross.

Jesus my Lord, I know His name,His name is all my trust;Nor will He put my soul to shame,Nor let my hope be lost.

Firm as His throne His promise stands,And He can well secureWhat I've committed to His hands,Till the decisive hour.

Then will He own my worthless nameBefore His Father's face,And in the new Jerusalem Appoint for me a place.
