There is a river we must pass over,When life’s sun goes to sleep in the west;There’ll be a light for me at the crossing,Guiding me to my home of sweet rest.

Soon I shall reach the brink of the river,Where the chill waters murmur their song;Nothing can harm me, nothing alarm me,While I am sailing ’cross to my home.

Down by the river soon I’ll be standing,Bidding farewell to friends on the shore;Sailing with Jesus on to that land whereHe is the Light that shines evermore.







There’ll be a light for me at the river,Guiding my soul across the dark foam;Down thru the valley, past the dark shadow,Jesus, my Light, will carry me home.
