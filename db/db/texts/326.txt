All to Jesus I surrender,All to Him I freely give;I will ever love and trust Him,In His presence daily live.

All to Jesus I surrender,Humbly at His feet I bow;Worldly pleasures all forsaken,Take me, Jesus, take me now.

All to Jesus I surrender,Make me, Savior, wholly Thine;Let me feel Thy Holy Spirit,Truly know that Thou art mine.

All to Jesus I surrender,Lord, I give myself to Thee,Fill me with Thy love and power,Let Thy blessing fall on me.





I surrender all,I surrender all;All to Thee, my blessed Savior,I surrender all.

I surrender all, I surrender all;
