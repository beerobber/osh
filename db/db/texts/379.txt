Standing with gaze out on the tomorrow,Mem’ries of childhood come from behind;Mem’ries from youth on which we can borrow,They will support, give strength to the mind.

As we go forth in faith, never knowingWhat is before us, what lies ahead,Looking to Christ, who with us is going,He knows the way, so why should we dread?

Tho’ we may doubt, our Lord is still faithful;Tho’ we may falter, Jesus will stand;He is our Leader; we will be grateful,Walking with Him and holding His hand.







Jesus is faithful, Jesus is faithful,He cannot fail me, Jesus is true;Leading me onward, onward to vict’ry,He is my Savior, He’ll see me thru.
