Loving me ere I knew Him,Calling with voice so sweet,Burdens of life I brought Him,Knelt at His wounded feet;Naught from that love can sever,Wonderful, changeless, free,Master, I’ll serve Thee ever,Never a Friend like Thee!

Sunlight of gladness giving,Filling my heart with cheer,E’er in His light I’m living,Ever I know Him near;Master, in Thee abiding,Shadows of earth must flee,Ever Thy children guiding,Never a Light like Thee!

Giving me gifts immortal,Life that endures for aye,Op’ning the heav’nly portal,Leading in royal way;Crowning with joy excelling,Heir of His grace I’ll be,Master, Thy praise I’m telling,Never a King like Thee!







Sing of a Friend so loyal,Sing of a Friend so true,Giving His gifts so royal,Blessings that aye are new.

King of the heav’nly glory,Lowly of earth was He;Master, we sing Thy story,Never was One like Thee.
