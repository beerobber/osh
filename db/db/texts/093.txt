The church of Christ we have today, A blessing from the Lord;He gave her to His Son to save, And take her home above.She was His bride before she knew She had a Husband dear;And when for her His choice was made, It caused her to draw near.

When she adorned with all His grace, Shall be exalted there,No queen with all her glory here Was ever half so fair.


The turtle dove is singing now; The winter's past and gone.Rise up, my fair one, come away! I'll take you home to stay.
