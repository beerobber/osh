The souls of those who seek for wealth the Lord shall soon require, But riches which are stored above shall never there expire; Fear not, little flock, fear not; thy Father knows thy need; Fear not, little flock fear not; He will His children feed. 

Behold and see how lilies grow; they do not toil nor weave, Yet kings in all their royal dress are not arrayed like these. Fear not, little flock, fear not; thy robe is sparkling white; Fear not, little flock, fear not; the Savior is your light. 

If God so clothe the forest green whose leaf will soon be gone, Shall He not much more glorify His chosen and foreknown? Fear not, little flock, fear not; thy God is on His throne; Fear not, little flock, fear not; He'll come and take you home.
