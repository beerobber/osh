We’ll meet beyond the shores of time,And we’ll all shout together in that morning.

O won’t that be a glor’ous day,And we’ll all shout together in that morning.

I long for that sweet home of rest,And we’ll all shout together in that morning.







In that morning, In that morning,And we’ll all shout together in that morning.











We’ll sing sweet songs in that bright clime,

My Lord will guide me all the way,

With all the ransomed and the blest,
