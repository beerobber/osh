Down at the feet of Jesus I go in humble prayer, Seeking in broken spirit To find a comfort there. Tho’ I am just a sinner, My Savior loves me so; He hears my heartfelt yearnings While I am bowed so low. 

While thus in sweet communion, I’ll tell Him what I feel; Tell Him that I believe Him, And that His love is real. I’ll thank Him for His favors To such a wretch as I; Then ask that He stay near me, And hear my ev’ry cry. 

Jesus, the Friend of sinners, Knows that I’m kneeling there; He’ll look upon my pleading, He’ll take me in His care. So let me feel His presence And rise to follow on, Straight in the steps of Jesus Until my day is gone.
