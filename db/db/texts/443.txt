When   all Thy mercies, O my God, My rising soul surveys, Transported with the view, I’m lost In wonder, love and praise. Unnumbered comforts on my soul, Thy tender care bestowed, Before my infant heart conceived From whom those comforts flowed.

When in the slipp’ry paths of youth, With heedless steps I ran, Thine arm, unseen, conveyed me safe, And led me up to man. Ten thousand thousand precious gifts, My daily thanks employ; Nor is the least a cheerful heart, That tastes those gifts with joy. 

Thru ev’ry period of my life, Thy goodness I’ll pursue; And, after death, in distant worlds The pleasing theme renew. In all eternity to Thee A grateful song I’ll raise; But  O! eternity’s too short To utter all Thy praise.
