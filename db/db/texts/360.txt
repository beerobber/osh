Here our heav’nly Father knows all we need before we ask,Here our heav’nly Father knows, and He cares;Here our heav’nly Father sees ev’ry sparrow when it falls,Here our heav’nly Father sees, and He cares.

See the lilies how they grow, and the beauty they display,He is watching over them, for He cares;When He waters with the dew, lilies raise their heads anew, He will do the same for you, for He cares.

When we find ourselves in need, then we to the Father plead,For He is our friend indeed, and He cares;He’ll be watching over us when we’re sleeping in the dust,And He’ll come again for us, for He cares.
