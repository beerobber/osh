Come, ye thankful people, come, Raise the song of harvest home;ÊAll is safely gathered in, Ere the winter storms begin;ÊGod, our Maker, doth provide For our wants to be supplied;ÊCome to God's own temple, come, Raise the song of harvest home.

All the world is God's own field, Fruit unto His praise to yield;ÊWheat and tares together sown, Unto joy or sorrow grown;ÊFirst the blade, and then the ear, Then the full corn shall appear;ÊLord of harvest, grant that we Wholesome grain and pure may be.

For the Lord our God shall come, And shall take His harvest home;ÊFrom His field shall in that day All offenses purge away,;Give His angels charge at last In the fire the tares to cast;ÊBut the fruitful ears to store In His garner evermore.

Even so, Lord, quickly come, To Thy final harvest home;ÊGather Thou Thy people in, Free from sorrow, free from sin;ÊThere, forever purified, In Thy presence to abide;ÊCome, with all Thine angels, come, Raise the glor'ous harvest home.
