Who flung the stars out into space,And holds them in their proper place?Who, like a curtain, stretched the skyTo make a place for birds to fly?Who sends the wind and sun and rainTo nourish fields of golden grain?Who forms the seed that makes the wheat,And gives us daily bread to eat? 

Who, in the winter, sends the snow?Oh, tell me who, if you should know;Who has designed each lovely flake?What wondrous power did it take?Who made the never-ending sea?Who formed the grass, the vine, the tree?Who made the cattle on the hills,And creeping things in rocks and rills?

Who holds all things within His hands?Who owns all houses, fields, and lands?Who keeps our souls each passing hour?No man has this almighty pow'r.It is the Lord and He alone!ÊMan has no glory of his own!We have no goodness we can claim,So let us publish His great name!

He takes a sinner, vain and wild,And makes him as a little child;Subdues his will and guides his feet,And draws him to the mercy seat.Let all creation lift its voice,And in the Lord let us rejoice!Let all His works praise and confessThe glory of His righteousness!
