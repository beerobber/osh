Soft as the voice of an angel,Breathing a lesson unheard,Hope with a gentle persuasion,Whispers her comforting word;Wait till the darkness is over,Wait till life’s tempest is done,Hope for the sunshine tomorrow,After the shower is gone.

If in the dusk of the twilight,Dim be the region afar,Will not the deepening darknessBrighten the glimmering star?Then when the night is upon us,Why should the heart sink away?When the dark midnight is over,Watch for the breaking of day.

Hope as an anchor so steadfast,Rends the dark veil for the soul,Whither the Master has entered,Robbing the grave of its goal;Come, then O come, glad fruition,Come to my sad, weary heart,Come, O Thou blest hope of glory,Never, O never depart.







Whispering hope, O how welcome Thy voice;Making my heart in its sorrow rejoice.

Whispering hope, whispering hope, welcome Thy voice, O how welcome Thy voice; Making my heart, making my heart in its sorrow rejoice.
