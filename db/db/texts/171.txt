How fearfully, how wondrously, our Lord has made us here;Within our souls His treasure wrought, that we need nothing fear.He forms within a heart of flesh, a heart of great design,That we may be at one with Him, from inwardly to shine. 

He plants in us the hidden seed to rest within our heart,Then waters with His heav’nly dew, a work of sublime art.Great Gardener, He tends with care, and makes the seed to grow,And fruit to bear, by Grace divine, His awesome plan to show.

Inside these earthly bodies now resides this hallowed guest,The Holy Spirit doth indwell, providing all the best.So may we live to honor Him, show forth this inner Gold;His temple well to occupy as sacred gifts unfold.

How fearfully, how wondrously, we are so finely wrought,Designed for health and peace and love, best jewels ever sought.Great mystery! God’s treasure is in earthen vessels cast,To nurture, teach, guide, and refine, and bring us home at last.
