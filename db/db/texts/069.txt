Worthy of praise is Christ our Redeemer;Worthy of glory, honor, and pow'r!Worthy of all our souls' adoration,Worthy art Thou! Worthy art Thou!

Lift up the voice in praise and devotion,Saints of all earth before Him should bow;Angels in heaven worship Him, saying,Worthy art Thou! Worthy art Thou!

Lord, may we come before Thee with singing,Filled with Thy Spirit, wisdom, and pow'r;May we ascribe Thee glory and honor,Worthy art Thou! Worthy art Thou!







Worthy of riches, blessings, and honor,Worthy of wisdom, glory, and pow'r!Worthy of earth and heaven's thanksgiving,Worthy art Thou! Worthy art Thou!

Worthy art Thou! Worthy art Thou! art Thou!
