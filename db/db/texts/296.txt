The worth of truth no tongue can tell, ’Twill do to buy but  not to sell; A large estate that soul has got, Who buys the truth and sells it not. Truth, like a diamond, shines most fair; More worth than pearls and rubies are; More rich than gold or silver coin: O may it always on us shine!

’Tis truth that binds, and truth makes free, And  sets the soul at liberty From sin and Satan’s heavy chain, And then within the heart doth reign. A freedom they enjoy indeed, That doth all freedom else exceed; Freedom from guilt, freedom from woe, And never more shall bondage know.

O happy they, who in their youth Are bro’t to know and love the truth! For none but those whom truth makes free Can e’er enjoy true liberty. Truth like a girdle let us wear, And always keep it clean and fair; And never let it once be told, That truth by us was ever sold.



























When Satan comes to tempt our minds, We’ll meet him with these blessed lines — Since Christ the Lord has won the field, We are determined not to yield.
