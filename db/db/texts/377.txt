Jesus, Thou art the sinner’s Friend, As such I look to Thee;Now in the fullness of Thy love,O Lord, remember me.

Remember Thy pure word of grace,Remember Calvary;Remember all Thy dying groans,And then remember me.

Thou wond’rous Advocate with God,I yield myself to Thee,While Thou art sitting on Thy throne,O Lord, remember me. 

I own I’m guilty, own I’m vile,Yet Thy salvation’s free;Then in Thy allabounding grace,O Lord, remember me.

How e’er forsaken or distressed,How e’er oppressed I be,How e’er afflicted here on earth,Do Thou remember me.

And when I close my eyes in death,And creature helps all flee,Then, O my great Redeemer God,I pray remember me.
