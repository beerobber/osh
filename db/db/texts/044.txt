To our Redeemer's glor'ous name Awake the sacred song; O may His love (immortal flame!) Tune ev'ry heart and tongue. 

His love! What mortal tho't can sketch, What mortal tongue display? Imagination's utmost stretch In wonder dies away. 

He left the radiant throne on high, Left the bright realms of bliss, And came to earth to bleed and die! Was ever love like this? 

He took the dying traitor's place, And suffered in his stead; For man, (O miracle of grace!) For man the Savior bled. 


Redeeming love has been my theme, And shall be till I die; And then I hope to sing this love In sweeter strains on high.
