Blest are the sons of peace,Whose hearts and hopes are one,Whose kind designs to serve and pleaseThro' all their actions run.Blest is the favored houseWhere zeal and friendship meet;Their songs of praise, their mingled vows,Make their communion sweet.
Thus when on Aaron's headThey poured the rich perfume,The oil thro' all his raiment spread,And pleasure filled the room.

Thus on the heav'nly hills The saints are blest above,Where joy like morning dew distils,And all the air is love.
