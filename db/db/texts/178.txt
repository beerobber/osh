Salvation! O melod’ous sound To wretched dying men!Salvation that from God proceeds, And leads to God again.

Rescued from hell’s eternal gloom, From fiends and fires and chains,Raised to a Paradise of bliss, Where love triumphant reigns.

But may a poor bewildered soul, Sinful and weak as mine,Presume to raise a trembling eye To blessings so divine?

The luster of so bright a bliss My feeble heart o’erbears,And unbelief almost perverts The promise into tears.
