Heal me by Thy mighty pow’r,Lord, I pray from day to day;I am weak and pain devoursAll my strength along the way.Hold me by Thy mighty armWhen the way is dark and drear;Always keep me safe from harm,Make me know that Thou art near.

Save me from the tempter’s pow’r,Help me all my burdens bear,Keep me in Thy love each hour,Safe from evil ev’rywhere.Make me thankful for Thy grace,Keep me humble in Thy sight;Guide me by the Holy Spir’t,Lead me safely by Thy might.

Clothe me with Thy righteousnessWhen life’s toils and cares molest,Help me, Lord, to do my best,Give my soul its longedfor rest.Show me, Lord, Thy smiling faceWhen my life on earth is o’er;All the pains and tears erase,By Thy presence bless me, Lord.
