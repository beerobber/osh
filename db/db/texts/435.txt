How tedious and tasteless the hoursWhen Jesus no longer I see!Sweet prospects, sweet birds, and sweet flow’rsHave all lost their sweetness to me.The midsummer sun shines but dim;The fields strive in vain to look gay;But when I am happy in Him,December’s as pleasant as May.

His name yields the richest perfume,And sweeter than music His voice;His presence disperses my gloomAnd makes all within me rejoice;I should, were He always thus nigh,Have nothing to wish or to fear;No mortal so happy as I;My summer would last all the year.

Content with beholding His face,My all to His pleasure resigned,No changes of season or placeWould make any change in my mind;While blest with a sense of His love,A palace a toy would appear;And prisons would palaces prove,If Jesus would dwell with me there.

Dear Lord, if indeed I am Thine,If Thou art my sun and my song,Say, why do I languish and pine,And why are my winters so long?Oh, drive these dark clouds from my sky;Thy soulcheering presence restore;Or take me unto Thee on high,Where winter and clouds are no more.
