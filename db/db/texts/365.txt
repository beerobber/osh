When I am weak, Your perfect strength upholds me. Therefore in pain, I never will despair. Though world and foe with troubles may enslave me, They cannot take me from Thy hand of care. 

I have a thorn, a messenger of Satan, To humble me and take away my pride. And yet I know that I am not forsaken, My Savior, Friend is always at my side. 

I will with joy face loss and pain and sorrow; I will not faint although my strength is gone. I will rejoice with everlasting song, For when I’m weak I find that I am strong! 







O, may the pow’r of Christ rest upon me, Thru trial and pain, may I Thy glory see! I sought the Lord and heard these words of mercy, “My grace sufficient is for thee.” 











“grace sufficient is for thee.”
