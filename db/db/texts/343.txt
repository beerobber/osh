To us a Child of hope is born, To us a Son is giv’n;Him shall the tribes of earth obey, Him all the hosts of heav’n;Him shall the tribes of earth obey, Him all the hosts of heav’n.

His name shall be the Prince of Peace,Forevermore adored,The Wonderful, the Counsellor, The great and mighty Lord;The Wonderful, the Counsellor, The great and mighty Lord.

His pow’r increasing, still shall spread,His reign no end shall know,Justice shall guard His throne above,And peace abound below;Justice shall guard His throne above,And peace abound below.

To us a Child of hope is born, To us a Son is giv’n;The Wonderful, the Counsellor, The mighty Lord of heav’n;The Wonderful, the Counsellor,The mighty Lord of heav’n.
