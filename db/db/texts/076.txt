For the beauty of the earth, For the glory of the skies,For the love which from our birth Over and around us lies;Christ, Our God, to Thee we raise This our hymn of grateful praise.

For the wonder of each hour Of the day and of the night,Hill and vale, and tree and flow'r, Sun and moon, and stars of light;Christ, Our God, to Thee we raise This our hymn of grateful praise.

For the joy of human love, Brother, sister, parent, child,Friends on earth, and friends above, For all gentle tho'ts and mild;Christ, Our God, to Thee we raise This our hymn of grateful praise.

For Thy Church that evermore Lifteth holy hands above,Off'ring up on ev'ry shore Her pure sacrifice of love;Christ, Our God, to Thee we raise This our hymn of grateful praise.
