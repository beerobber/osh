How I love the great RedeemerWho is doing so much for me;With what joy I tell the storyOf the love that makes men free.Till my earthly life is ended,(I will send) (songs above) I will send songs above,Then beside the crystal seaMore and more my soul shall bePraising Jesus and His love.

He has purchased my redemption,Rolled my burden of sin away,And is walking on beside me,Growing dearer day by day.That is why I sing His praises.(That is why) (joy is mine) That is why joy is mine,That is why forevermoreI shall sing of love divine. On the everlasting shore

Glory be to Him forever!Endless praises to Christ the Lamb!He has filled my life with sunshine,He has made me what I am,O that ev’ryone would know Him,O that all would adore!O that all would trust the love Of the mighty Friend aboveAnd be His forevermore.







He is ev’rything to me, to me,He is ev’rything to me,And ev’rything shall always be;I will never cease to raise A song of gladness in His praise;Here, and in the world above,My soul shall sing of saving love;Life, and light, and joy is He,The precious Friend who died for me.

He is ev’rything to me,And ev’rything shall always be;I will never cease to raise A song of gladness in His praise;Here, and in the world above,My soul shall sing of saving love;Life, and light, and joy is He,The precious Friend who died for me.









I will send songs above, More and more my soul shall be 

 That is why joy is mine, On the everlasting shore
