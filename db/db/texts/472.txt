Blessed Savior, we adore Thee,We Thy love and grace proclaim;Thou art mighty, Thou art holy,Glor’ous is Thy matchless name.

Great Redeemer, Lord and Master,Light of all eternal days;Let the saints of ev’ry nationSing Thy just and endless praise!

From the throne of heaven’s gloryTo the cross of sin and shame,Thou didst come to die a ransom,Guilty sinners to reclaim!

Come, O come, immortal Savior,Come and take Thy royal throne;Come, and reign, and reign forever,Be the kingdom all Thine own!





Glorious, Glorious,Glor’ous is Thy name, O Lord!Glorious, Glorious,Glor’ous is Thy name, O Lord!
