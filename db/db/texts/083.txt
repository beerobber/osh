Blessed are the saints who renderFaithful services of loveTo the Lord's dear little childrenAs they seek those things above.Blessed are they who go preachingWithout price, but trusting God,Teaching as did the Apostles,Walking in the paths they trod.

Blessed are they who give freely To the pastors that God sends;For He teaches that His servants Shall be fed from fields they tend. 

They are favored who give freelyOf their substance and their time,For God loves a cheerful giver,And their joy shall be sublime.

Children then should serve each other,Never asking if it pays;"Cast thy bread upon the waters,"'Twill return in many ways.

Cast your bread upon the waters,Never asking if it pays;God has promised to return itTo you after many days.
