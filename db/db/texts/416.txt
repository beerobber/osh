God sent His Son, they called Him Jesus;He came to love, heal, and forgive;He lived and died to buy my pardon,An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives.

How sweet to hold a newborn baby,And feel the pride and joy he gives;But greater still the calm assurance:This child can face uncertain days because He lives.

And then one day I’ll cross the river,I’ll fight life’s final war with pain;And then as death gives way to vict’ry,I’ll see the lights of glory, and I’ll know He reigns.







Because He lives, I can face tomorrow,Because He lives, all fear is gone;Because I know He holds the future,And life is worth the living just because He lives.
