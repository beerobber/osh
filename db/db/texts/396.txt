Almighty King! whose wondrous handSupports the weight of sea and land;Whose grace is such a boundless store,No heart shall break that sighs for more.

Thy providence supplies my food,And ’tis Thy blessing makes it good;My soul is nourished by Thy word,Let soul and body praise the Lord.

My streams of outward comfort cameFrom Him, Who built this earthly frame;Whate’er I want His bounty gives,By Whom my soul forever lives.

Either His hand preserves from pain,Or, if I feel it, heals again;From Satan’s malice shields my breast,Or overrules it for the best.

Forgive the song that falls so lowBeneath the gratitude I owe;It means Thy praise, however poor,An angel’s song can do no more.
