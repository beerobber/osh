When the storms of life are raging, Stand by me;When the storms of life are raging, Stand by me.When the world is tossing meLike a ship upon the sea,Thou who rulest wind and water, Stand by me.

In the midst of tribulations, Stand by me;In the midst of tribulations, Stand by me.When the hosts of hell assail,And my strength begins to fail,Thou who never lost a battle, Stand by me.

In the midst of faults and failures, Stand by me;In the midst of faults and failures, Stand by me.When I do the best I can,And my friends misunderstand,Thou who knowest all about me, Stand by me.

In the midst of persecution, Stand by me;In the midst of persecution, Stand by me.When my foes in battle arrayUndertake to stop my way,Thou who saved Paul and Silas, Stand by me.

When IÕm growing old and feeble, Stand by me;When IÕm growing old and feeble, Stand by me.When my life becomes a burden,And IÕm nearing chilly Jordan,O Thou ÒLily of the Valley,Ó Stand by me.















stand by me; stand by me; stand by me. 

by me; by me.
