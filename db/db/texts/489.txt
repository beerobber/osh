Blow ye the trumpet, blow The gladly solemn sound; Let all the nations know, To earth’s remotest bound. The year of jubilee is come, The year of jubilee is come, Return, ye ransomed sinners, home. home. 

Exalt the Lamb of God, The sinatoning Lamb; Redemption by His blood Thru all the lands proclaim. 

Jesus, your great High Priest, Has full atonement made; Ye weary spirits, rest, Ye mourning souls, be glad. 







The year of jubiThe lee is come, year of jubilee is come, Return, ye ransomed sinners, home. home. 

The year of jubilee is come, The year of jubilee is come, Return, ye ransomed sinners, home. home.
