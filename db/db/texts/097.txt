Savior, visit Thy plantation,Grant us, Lord, a gracious rain;All will come to desolation,Unless Thou return again.
Keep no longer at a distance,Shine upon us from on high;Lest, for want of Thine assistance,Ev'ry plant should droop and die.

Surely once Thy gardens flourished,Ev'ry part looked gay and green;Then Thy word our spirits nourished,Happy seasons we have seen.

Dearest Savior, hasten hither,Thou canst make them bloom again;O permit them not to wither,Let not all our hopes be vain.
Lord, revive us, Lord revive us,All our help must come from Thee;Lord, revive us, O revive us,All our help must come from Thee.
