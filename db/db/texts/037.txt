O God, beyond all praising, we worship you today, and sing the love amazing that songs cannot repay; for we can only wonder at ev'ry gift you send, at blessings without number, and mercies without end; we lift our hearts before you and wait upon your word, we honor and adore you, our great and mighty Lord. 

Then hear, O gracious Savior, accept the love we bring, that we who know your favor may serve you as our King; and whether our tomorrows be filled with good or ill, we'll triumph thru our sorrows and rise to bless you still; to marvel at your beauty and glory in your ways, and make a joyful duty our sacrifice of praise.
