In all my Lord’s appointed waysMy journey I’ll pursue;Hinder me not, ye muchloved saints,For I must go with you.

Thru floods and flames, if Jesus leads,I’ll follow where He goes;Hinder me not! Shall be my cry,Tho earth and hell oppose.

Thru duty and thru trials, too,I’ll go at His command;Hinder me not, for I am boundTo my Immanuel’s land.

And when my Savior calls me home,Still this my cry shall be:Hinder me not! come, welcome death;I’ll gladly go with Thee.





I feel like, I feel likeI’m on my journey home;I feel like, I feel likeI’m on my journey home. home.
