Come, Thou Almighty King, 
Help us Thy name to sing,Help us to praise; 
Father,  allglorious, 
O'er all victorious; 
Come and reign over us, 
Ancient of Days.Come, Thou Incarnate Word,
Gird on Thy mighty sword,ÊOur prayer attend; 
Come and Thy people bless,
And give Thy word success;
Spirit of holiness,
On us descend.Come, Holy Comforter,
Thy sacred witness bearIn this glad hour; 
Thou who almighty art, 
Now rule in ev'ry heart, 
And ne'er from us depart, 
Spirit of pow'r.

To the great One in Three 
Eternal praises beHence evermore; 
His sov'reign majesty 
May we in glory see, 
And to eternity Love and adore.
