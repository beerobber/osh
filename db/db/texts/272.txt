Looking back thru the years I can see my dear Lord,As they nailed Him that day to the tree;For the love that He bore me, His lifeblood He poured,When His body was broken for me.

For my sins and transgressions the dear Savior diedOn the cross, died in great agony;Nails thru hands and thru feet and the spear thru His side,When His body was broken for me.

Yes, forever and ever His great love was proved,When He suffered on dark Calvary;And the curse of the law was forever removed,When His body was broken for me.







O love beyond human expression,Compassion so boundless and free;Jesus proved His great wealth of affectionWhen His body was broken for me.
