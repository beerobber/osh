I need the prayers of those I love,While trav’ling o’er life’s rugged way,That I may true and faithful be, And live for Jesus ev’ry day.

I need the prayers of those I love,To help me in each trying hour,To bear my tempted soul to Him,That He may keep me by His pow’r.

I want my friends to pray for me,To hold me up on wings of faith,That I may walk the narrow way,Kept by our Father’s glor’ous grace.







I want my friends to pray for me,To bear my tempted soul above,And intercede with God for me;I need the prayers of those I love.
