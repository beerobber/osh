Hark! the voice of love and mercy Sounds aloud from Calvary;See, it rends the rocks asunder, Shakes the earth, and veils the sky!“It is finished, it is finished,” Hear the dying Savior cry,“It is finished, it is finished,” Hear the dying Savior cry.

It is finished, O what pleasure Do these charming words afford!Heav’nly blessings without measure Flow to us from Christ the Lord;“It is finished, it is finished,” Saints the dying words record,“It is finished, it is finished,” Saints the dying words record.

Finished, all the types and shadows Of the ceremonial law! Finished, all that God has promised, Death and hell no more shall awe; “It is finished, it is finished,” Saints, from hence your comforts draw,“It is finished, it is finished,” Saints, from hence your comforts draw.

Happy souls, approach the table, Taste the soulreviving food;Nothing half so sweet and pleasant As the Savior’s flesh and blood;“It is finished, it is finished,” Christ has borne the heavy load,“It is finished, it is finished,” Christ has borne the heavy load.

Tune your harps anew, ye seraphs, Join to sing the pleasing theme;All on earth and all in heaven Join to praise Emmanuel’s name!Hallelujah! hallelujah! Glory to the bleeding Lamb,Hallelujah! hallelujah! Glory to the bleeding Lamb.
