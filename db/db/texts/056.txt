Repeat the story o'er and o'er, Of grace so full and free; I love to hear it more and more, Since grace has rescued me. 

Of peace I only knew the name, Nor found my soul its rest; Until the sweetvoiced angel came To soothe my weary breast. 

My highest place is lying low At my Redeemer's feet; No real joy in life I know, But in His service sweet. 

And O what rapture will it be With all the hosts above! To sing thru all eternity The wonders of His love. 



The half was never told, The half was never told, Of grace divine, so wonderful, The half was never told. 

Of peace divine, 

Of joy divine, 

Of love divine, 

The half was never, never told, The half was never, never told, The half was never, never told. 



Of grace divine, so wonderful, 

Of peace divine, so wonderful, 

Of joy divine, so wonderful, 

Of love divine, so wonderful,
