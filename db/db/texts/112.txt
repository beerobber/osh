Jesus has a table spread,Where the saints of God are fed,He invites His chosen people, "Come and dine;"

The disciples came to land,ÊThus obeying Christ's command,For the Master called to them, "Oh, come and dine;"

Soon the Lamb will take His brideTo be ever at His side,All the host of Heaven will assembled be;

"Come and dine," the Master calleth,"Come and dine;ÊYou may feast at Jesus' table all the time;ÊHe who fed the multitude,Turned the water into wine,To the hungry calleth now, "Come and dine."

Oh, come and dine; Oh, come and dine; 









With His manna He doth feedAnd supplies our ev'ry need;Oh, 'tis sweet to sup with Jesus all the time!

There they found their hearts' desire,ÊBread and fish upon the fire;Thus He satisfies the hungry ev'ry time.

Oh, 'twill be a glor'ous sight,All the saints in spotless white;And with Jesus they will feast eternally.
