Blessed Jesus! Thee we sing; Thou of life th’ eternal spring; Thou art worthy, Thou alone, Thou the Rock and Cornerstone.

’Tis from Thee salvation flows; This the ransomed sinner knows. Thou, O Christ, art all his plea, When he sees his poverty.

None shall glory in Thy sight Of their labors, e’er so bright; All whoIare taught by Thee shall know, Living faith from God must flow.

Grace shall be our lovely theme; Free redemption, glorious scheme! This will be the song above; Praise to Jesus’ bleeding love.
