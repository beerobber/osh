Lord, how delightful 'tis to seeA whole assembly worship Thee;At once they sing, at once they pray,They hear of heav'n and learn the way.

I have been there, and still would go,'Tis like a little heav'n below;Not all that hell or sin can sayShall tempt me to forget this day.

O write upon my mem'ry, Lord,The text and doctrine of Thy word,That I may break Thy laws no more,But love Thee better than before.

With tho'ts of Christ and things divineFill up this foolish heart of mine,That hoping pardon thru His blood,I may lie down and wake with God.
