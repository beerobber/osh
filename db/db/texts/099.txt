Ye little flock, whom Jesus feeds,Dismiss your anxious cares;Look to the Shepherd of your souls,And smile away your fears.

Tho' wolves and lions prowl around,His staff is your defense;'Midst sands and rocks your Shepherd's voiceCalls streams and pastures thence.

Your Father will a kingdom give,And give it with delight;His feeblest child His love shall callTo triumph in His sight.

Ten thousand praises, Lord, we bringFor sure supports like these;And o'er the pious dead we singThy living promises.

For all we hope, and they enjoy,We bless the Savior's name;Nor shall that stroke disturb the songWhich breaks this mortal frame.Ê
