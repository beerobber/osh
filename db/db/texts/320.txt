Precious is our Rock of Ages, He who is our lively stone; Precious is our living Savior While we trust in Him alone. 

Precious when by faith we see Him As He died on Calvary; Made an end of our transgression. Paid the debt and set us free. 

Precious as our loving brother, As our Counselor and Friend; As our light and intercessor He will guide us to the end. 

Precious as our Priest and Prophet To instruct us in the way, By His virtue, grace, and mercy Gives us strength from day to day. 





How I long to meet this Savior And to see Him face to face! And to tell that precious story How He saved me By His grace. 

 How I long And to see And to tell How He saved me yes, by His grace
