There is coming a day when no heartaches shall come,No more clouds in the sky, no more tears to dim the eye;All is peace forevermore on that happy golden shore,What a day, glorious day that will be!

There’ll be no sorrow there, no more burdens to bear,No more sickness, no pain, no more parting over there;And forever I will be with the One who died for me,What a day, glorious day that will be!









What a day that will be when my Jesus I shall see,And I look upon His face, the One who saved me by His grace;When He takes me by the hand, and leads me through the Promised Land,What a day, glorious day that will be!
