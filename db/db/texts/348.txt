Thy way, not mine, O Lord,However dark it be;O lead me by Thine own right hand,Choose Thou the path for me!

Smooth let it be, or rough,It still will be the best;Winding or straight, it matters not:It leads me to Thy rest.

I dare not choose my lot,I would not if I might;But choose Thou for me, O my Lord!So shall I walk aright.

The Kingdom that I seekIs Thine, so let the wayThat leads to it, O Lord, be Thine!Else I must surely stray.

Not mine, not mine the choice,If things be great, or small;Be Thou my Guide, my Guard, my Strength,My Wisdom and my All!
