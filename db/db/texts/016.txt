As we go up to worship here,Sometimes in deep distress;We look to God to calm our fear,And fill our souls with rest.

Our hearts sometimes so empty feel,The cross appears so great;Before His throne we humbly kneel;Oh, what a great retreat!

O, grant to us, most gracious Lord,Thy blessed truths to hear;To see the beauty of Thy word;And feel Thy presence near.

Sometimes the light is from us drawn,And we go down in grief;Ere long He makes His presence known;And brings us sweet relief.O, could we know our Master's will,And walk in duty's way;He'll surely come our cups to fill,And that without delay.
