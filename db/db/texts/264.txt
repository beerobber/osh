Faith of our fathers! living stillIn spite of dungeon, fire and sword,O how our hearts beat high with joyWhen e’er we hear that glor’ous word!Faith of our fathers! holy faith!We will be true to thee till death!

Our fathers, chained in prisons dark,Were still in heart and conscience free;How sweet would be their children’s fate,If they, like them, could die for thee?Faith of our fathers! holy faith!We will be true to thee till death!

Faith of our fathers! we will loveBoth friend and foe in all our strife;And preach thee too, as love knows how,By kindly words and virtuous life;Faith of our fathers! holy faith!We will be true to thee till death!
