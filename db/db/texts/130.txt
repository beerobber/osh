One there is above all others, Well deserves the name of Friend;His is love beyond a brother's, Costly, free, and knows no end!

Which of all our friends, to save us, Could, or would, have shed his blood?But our Jesus died to have us Reconciled in Him, to God.

When He lived on earth abased, Friend of sinners was His name;Now, above all glory raised, He rejoices in the same.

O for grace our hearts to soften! Teach us, Lord, at length to love,We, alas, forget too often What a Friend we have above.
