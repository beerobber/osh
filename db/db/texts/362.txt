God has not promised skies always blue,Flowerstrewn pathways All our lives thru,God has not promised sun without rain,Peace without sorrow, joy without pain.

But God has promised strength as our day,Rest when we labor, Light on the way,Grace for our trials, help from above,Unfading kindness, undying love.

Tho’ we have mingled sunshine and rain,Clouds decked with rainbows, Joy mixed with pain,Let us still trust His mercies right onAnd sing His praises all the day long.
