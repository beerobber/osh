Blessed Jesus, precious Savior, our Redeemer, Priest and King, By Thy blood we are delivered from sin and shame. Now we praise Thee and adore Thee as we go this way, And our souls are ever hast’ning to Thy promised day. When the ev’ning shades are falling, And we’ve come to pass away, Our souls will still be hast’ning To Thy promised day. 

Thou art worthy of all honor; there is none to match Thy name. Thou did choose us and did save us, at Thy call we came. For as sheep we know Thy voice and follow to obey, Trusting always in Thy sure word of the promised day. 

 Thou art full of grace and mercy; Thou hast saved us, ev’ryone! ’Tho we had nothing to offer, now Thy work is done. Grant us mercy, grant us guidance thru this weary land; Thou the Lord of resurrection, let us feel Thy hand.
