I love the quietness of the morning,The peaceful beauty of the day;I love to go there to my bower,And humbly bow my head and pray.

Oh, what a joy and peace it gives meTo talk to Jesus in a prayer;It gives me hope and consolation,It lifts me from my ev’ry care.

Things seem brighter in the morning,As God so boldly shows His face;It makes me want to shout His praises,And thank Him for amazing grace.







Oh, that His grace and mercy guide me,That when it’s finished I can say,When the evening sun is setting,I have walked with God today.
