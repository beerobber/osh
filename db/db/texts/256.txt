Sweet to rejoice in lively hopeThat when my change shall come,Angels shall gather ’round my bedAnd waft my spirit home.

There shall my disembodied soulView Jesus and adore,Be with His likeness satisfied,And grieve and sin no more.

Shall see Him wear that very fleshOn which my guilt was lain,His love intense, His merit fresh, As tho’ but newly slain.

If such the views which grace unfold,Weak as it is below,What rapture shall the church aboveIn Jesus’ presence know.





We are passing away, We are passing away,We are passing away To that great rising day.
