Thus far the Lord has led me on;Thus far His pow’r prolongs my days;And ev’ry ev’ning shall make knownSome fresh memorials of His grace.

Much of my time has run to waste,And I perhaps am near my home;But He forgives my follies past;He gives me strength for days to come.

In vain the sons of earth or hellTell me a thousand frightful things;My God in safety makes me dwellBeneath the shadow of His wings.

I lay my body down to sleep;Peace is the pillow for my head;While wellappointed angels keepTheir watchful stations ’round my bed.
