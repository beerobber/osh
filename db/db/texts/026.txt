Blest Jesus, while in mortal fleshI hold my frail abode,Still would my spirit rest on Thee,My Savior and my God.

On Thy dear cross I fix my eyes,Then raise them to Thy seat,Till love dissolves my inmost soulAt my Redeemer's feet.

Be dead, my heart, to worldly charms,Be dead to ev'ry sin,And tell the boldest foe withoutThat Jesus reigns within.
