If my people’s hearts are humbled,If they pray and seek my face,If they turn away from evil,I will not withhold my grace.I will hear their prayers from heaven;I will pardon ev’ry sin.If my people’s hearts are humbled,I will surely heal their land.

Then my eyes will see their sorrow,Then my ears will hear their plea.If my people’s hearts are humbled,I will set their nation free.If my people’s hearts are humbled,If they pray and seek my face,If they turn away from evil, I will not withhold my grace.
