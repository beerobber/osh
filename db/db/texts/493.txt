Oh, what have I done in Thy name, dear Lord,As I come to the close of this day?Have I looked up to heaven and Thee,Or, have my steps gone astray?

Have I let my light shine as it should,Plain enough that others could see?Or, have my deeds been so worthless and boldThat others are blinded to Thee?

How hard, oh how hard is my pilgrimage here;How little the good is in me.But, guide my hands, guide my feet, dear Lord,In paths that will honor Thee.







Oh, what have I done,Oh, what have I done in Thy name, dear Lord, today?Have I looked up to heaven and Thee, Or have my steps gone astray?Or have my steps gone astray?











The day is past and gone,The ev’ning shades appear;O may we all remember wellThe night of time is near.

We lay our garments by,Upon our beds we rest;So death will soon disrobe us allOf what we here possess.

Lord, keep us safe this night,Secure from all our fears;May angels guard us while we sleep,Till morning light appears.

And when we early riseAnd view th’unwearied sun;May we set out to win the prize,And after glory run.

And when our days are done,And we from time remove,O may we in Thy bosom rest,The bosom of Thy love.
