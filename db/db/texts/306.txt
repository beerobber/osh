Must Jesus bear the cross alone,And all the world go free?No, there’s a cross for ev’ryone,And there’s a cross for me.

The consecrated cross I’ll bearTill death shall set me free;And then go home, my crown to wear,For there’s a crown for me.

Upon the crystal pavement, downAt Jesus’ pierced feet,With joy I’ll cast my golden crown,And His dear name repeat.

O precious cross! O glor’ous crown!O resurrection day!Ye angels from the stars come downAnd bear my soul away.
