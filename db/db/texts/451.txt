There is an unseen hand to me,That leads thru ways I cannot see;While going thru this world of woe,This hand still leads me as I go.

His hand has led thru shadows drear,And while it leads I have no fear;I know ’twill lead me to that home,Where sin nor sorrow e’er can come.

I long to see my Savior’s faceAnd sing the story “Saved by Grace;”And there upon that Golden Strand,I’ll praise Him for His guiding hand.







I’m trusting to the unseen hand,That guides me thru this weary land;And some sweet day I’ll reach that strand,Still guided by the unseen hand.
