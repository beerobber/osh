From ev’ry stormy wind that blows,From ev’ry swelling tide of woes,There is a calm, a sure retreat,’Tis found beneath the mercy seat,’Tis found beneath the mercy seat.

There is a place where Jesus shedsThe oil of gladness on our heads;A place of all on earth most sweet;It is the bloodbought mercy seat,It is the bloodbought mercy seat.

There is a scene where spirits blend,Where friend holds fellowship with friend;Tho’ sundered far, by faith they meetAround one common mercy seat,Around one common mercy seat.

Ah! whither could we flee for aidWhen tempted, desolate, dismayed?Or how the hosts of hell defeat,Had suff’ring saints no mercy seat,Had suff’ring saints no mercy seat?

There, there on eagles’ wings we soar,And sin and guilt seem there no more;And heav’n comes down our souls to greet,And glory crowns the mercy seat,And glory crowns the mercy seat.

O let my hand forget her skill,My tongue be silent, cold, and still;This bounding heart forget to beat,If I forget the mercy seat,If I forget the mercy seat.
