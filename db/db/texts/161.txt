One day when heaven was filled with His praises,One day when sin was as black as could be,Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin —Dwelt amongst men, my example is He!

One day they led Him up Calvary’s mountain,One day they nailed Him to die on the tree;Suffering anguish, despised and rejected;Bearing our sins, my Redeemer is He!

One day they left Him alone in the garden,One day He rested, from suffering free;Angels came down o’er His tomb to keep vigil;Hope of the hopeless, my Savior is He!

One day the grave could conceal Him no longer,One day the stone rolled away from the door;Then He arose, over death He had conquered;Now is ascended, my Lord evermore!

One day the trumpet will sound for His coming,One day the skies with His glories will shine;Wonderful day, my beloved ones bringing;Glorious Savior, this Jesus is mine!



Living, He loved me; dying, He saved me;Buried He carried my sins far away;Rising, He justified freely forever;One day He’s coming — O glorious day!
