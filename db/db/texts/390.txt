Now in Thy praise, eternal King,Be all my tho’ts employed;While of this precious truth I sing,“Cast down but not destroyed;”“Cast down but not destroyed,”“Cast down but not destroyed;”While of this precious truth I sing,“Cast down but not destroyed.”

Oft the united pow’rs of hellMy soul have sore annoyed;And yet I live this truth to tell,“Cast down but not destroyed;”“Cast down but not destroyed,”“Cast down but not destroyed;”And yet I live this truth to tell,“Cast down but not destroyed.”

In all the paths thru which I’ve passed,What mercies I’ve enjoyed!And this shall be my song at last,“Cast down but not destroyed;”“Cast down but not destroyed,”“Cast down but not destroyed;”And this shall be my song at last,“Cast down but not destroyed.”

When I with God in heav’n appear,There shall I Him adore;Destroyed shall be my sin and fear,And I cast down no more;And I cast down no more,And I cast down no more;Destroyed shall be my sin and fear,And I cast down no more.
