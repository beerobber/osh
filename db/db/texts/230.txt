If you have friends in gloryland Who’ve left because of pain;There’ll be no pain in gloryland, They’ll suffer not again.

The lame in gloryland will walk, The blind up there will see;The deaf in gloryland will hear, The dumb will talk to me.

There’ll be no sun in gloryland, The moon and stars won’t shine:For Christ Himself is light up there. We’ll live on love divine.







If you have friends in gloryland Who’ve left because of pain;There’ll be no pain in gloryland, They’ll suffer not again.

So weep not friends, I’m going home. Up there we’ll die no more. No coffins will be made up there, No graves on that bright shore.
