Flee as a bird to your mountain,Thou who art weary of sin;Go to the clear flowing fountain,Where you may wash and be clean.Fly for th’ Avenger is near thee;Call and the Savior will hear thee;He on His bosom will bear thee,Thou who art weary of sin, O, thou who art weary of sin.

He will protect thee forever,Wipe ev’ry sad falling tear;He will forsake thee, no, never,Sheltered so tenderly there.Haste, then, the hours fast are flying,Spend not the moments in sighing;Cease from your sorrow and crying;The Savior will wipe ev’ry tear,The Savior will wipe ev’ry tear.
