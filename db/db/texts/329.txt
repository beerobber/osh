Spirit of God, descend upon my heart;Wean it from earth, thru all its pulses move;Stoop to my weakness, mighty as Thou art,And make me love Thee as I ought to love.

Hast Thou not bid us love Thee, God and King?All, all Thine own, soul, heart and strength and mind;I see Thy cross, there teach my heart to cling;O let me seek Thee, and O let me find.

Teach me to feel that Thou art always nigh;Teach me the struggles of the soul to bear,To check the rising doubt, the rebel sigh;Teach me the patience of unanswered prayer.

Teach me to love Thee as Thine angels love,One holy passion filling all my frame;The baptism of the heav’ndescended Dove,My heart an altar, and Thy love the flame.
