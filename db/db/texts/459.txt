Love is the greatest thingThis world has ever known,It fits us for God’s service hereAnd leads us nearer home.

Without love, preaching’s vain,Religion just a show,Trees that here only cumber groundOn which no fruit will grow.

Tho’ we should give our goodsTo feed and clothe the poor,It could not save us from our sin,Nor open heaven’s door.

And tho’ our bodies burnIn human sacrifice,This never could attone for sin,Jesus must pay the price.

Love makes us suffer longAnd not to seek our own,Helps us to act as Christians should,And imitate God’s Son.

Our faith and hope will endWhen heaven we shall see,But charity will still live onIn all eternity.
