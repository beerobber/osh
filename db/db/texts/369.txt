As we travel thru the desert,Storms beset us by the way;But beyond the river JordanLies a field of endless day.

Oh, my brother are you wearyOf the roughness of the way?Does your strength begin to fail you,And your vigor to decay?

Jesus, Jesus will go with you,He will lead you to the throne;He who dyed His garments for you,And the winepress trod alone.

Farther on, oh, how much farther?Count the milestones one by one.Know no counting, only trusting,“It is better farther on.”

Hark! A voice from Eden stealing,Softly in an undertone.Hark! I hear its gentle whisper,“It is better farther on.”

At my grave, oh, still be singing,Tho’ you weep for one that’s gone;Sing it as we once did sing it:,“It is better farther on.”

Farther on, still go farther,Count the milestones one by one;Jesus will forsake you never,“It is better farther on.”
