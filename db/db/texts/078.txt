I sat by my SaviorAnd looked on His face,'Twas full of His gloryAnd shining with grace.

His smile was endearing,His touch so divine,His presence most cheering,This Savior of mine.

I could not believe it,That one such as I,Could sit down with JesusIn glory on high.

The poorest of mortalsI felt on that hour,Yet rich with my Savior,Endued with His pow'r.

O wonderful story,ÊO could I still dream,And rest with my SaviorBy life's flowing stream.
