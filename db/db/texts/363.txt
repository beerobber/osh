Come, all ye mourning pilgrims dear,Who’re bound for Canaan’s land,Take courage and fight valiantly,Stand fast with sword in hand.Our Captain’s gone before us,Our Father’s holy Son,Then pilgrims dear, pray do not fear,But let us follow on.   

We have a howling wildernessTo Canaan’s happy shore,A land of dearth and pits and snaresWhere chilling winds do roar;But Jesus will be with us,And guard us on the way;Tho’ enemies examine us,He’ll teach us what to say.

Sweet rivers of salvation all Thru Canaan’s land do roll;The beams of day bring glitt’ring scenes,Illuminate the soul.I see bright clouds of glory,Above the fields so white,And gentle gales that bear my soulTo Jesus, my delight.
