Nearer, my God, to Thee,Nearer to Thee!E’en tho’ it be a crossThat raiseth me;Still all my song shall be,

Tho’ like the wanderer,The sun gone down,Darkness be over me,My rest a stone,Yet in my dreams I’d be

There let the way appear,Steps unto heav’n;All that Thou sendest me,In mercy giv’n;Angels to beckon me

Then with my waking tho’ts,Bright with Thy praise,Out of my stony griefsBethel I’ll raise;So by my woes to be

Or if on joyful wing,Cleaving the sky,Sun, moon, and stars forgot,Upward I’ll fly;Still all my song shall be



Nearer, my God, to Thee,Nearer, my God, to Thee,Nearer to Thee!
