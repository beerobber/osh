Oh! Christ, He is the fountain, The deep, sweet well of love!The streams on earth I've tasted, More deep I'll drink above.There, to an ocean fullness, His mercy doth expand;Oh! I am my Beloved's, And my Beloved's mine!He brings a poor vile sinner Into His "house of wine!"I stand upon His merit, I know no other stand;

The bride eyes not her garment, But her dear Bridegroom's face;I will not gaze at glory, But on my King of Grace.Not at the crown He giveth, But on His pierced hand;


And glory, glory dwelleth In my Immanuel's land.

Not e'en where glory dwelleth In my Immanuel's land.

The Lamb is all the glory Of my Immanuel's land.
