Our Lord and King with joy, A song of praise He sings, And from the heart of His desire Our thankful song we bring. The Father goes before With ev’ry perfect gift — And from the storehouse of His love, He grants that we forever live! 

A crown of victory The Father gave His Own; Death and the grave beneath His feet As He retakes His throne. He asked for length of days, Thou gavest evermore! And now the objects of His love Join their Redeemer and adore!

He is forever blessed; And we are hid in Him! Therefore with gladness in our hearts, We sing this thankful hymn. Warmed by Thy countenance, We see our lives made new; Thru wondrous mercies from on High, We are preserved and ne’er shall move! 







Be Thou exalted, LORD; Raised high in strength Thine Own! So will we sing and praise Thy pow’r That soon will call us home!
