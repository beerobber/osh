Awake and sing the song Of Moses and the Lamb;Wake ev'ry heart and ev'ry tongueTo praise the Savior's name.
Sing of His dying love,Sing of His risen pow'r;Sing how He intercedes aboveFor those whose sins He bore.

Sing till we feel our heartsAscending with our tongues;Sing till the love of sin departs,And grace inspires our hearts.

Soon we shall hear Him say,Ye blessed children, come;Soon will He call us hence away,And take His wand'rers home.
