O Jesus! sweet the tears I shed,While at Thy cross I kneel,Gaze on Thy wounded, fainting head,And all Thy sorrows feel;My heart dissolves to see Thee bleed,This heart so hard before,I hear Thee for the guilty plead,And grief o’erflows the more.

’Twas for the sinful Thou didst die,And I a sinner stand,What love speaks from Thy dying eye,And from each pierced hand!I know this cleansing blood of ThineWas shed, dear Lord, for me,For even all – oh, grace divine! –Who look by faith on Thee. 

O Christ of God! O spotless Lamb!By love my soul is drawn;Henceforth forever Thine I am,Here life and peace are born;In patient hope the cross I’ll bear,Thine arm shall be my stay,And Thou, enthroned, my soul shall spareOn that great judgment day.
