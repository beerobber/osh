The blessed Spirit, like the wind,Blows when and where He please;

He sheds abroad the Father’s love,Applies redeeming blood,









He forms the inward mind afresh,Subdues the love of sin,He takes away the heart of stoneAnd plants His grace within.

Lord, fill each dead, benighted soulWith life and light and joy!None can Thy mighty pow’r control,Thy glor’ous work destroy.









How happy are the men who feelThe soulenliv’ning breeze!

Bids both our grief and guilt remove,And brings us near to God.
