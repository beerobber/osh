Let us sing of Jesus and His love,Of the Savior who died on Calvary;Tell the world about those things above,And the wonderful grace that makes us free.Sing the praise of Him who is our Friend,He is pleading our cause before the throne;He will go with us unto the end,And He never will leave us all alone.

How we ought to love this Friend divine,And be faithful in service ev'ry day;Running on with patience all the time,He has promised to bless us all the way.


Sing of His love, glorious love,And the wonderful grace that made you free;Sing of His love, glorious love,He will love you thru all eternity.

Glorious love, glorious love, Sing of His love, glorious love,
