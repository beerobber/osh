Glor'ous things of thee are spoken,Zion, city of our God!He whose word cannot be broken,Formed thee for His own abode.On the Rock of Ages founded,What can shake thy sure repose?With salvation's walls surrounded, Thou may'st smile at all thy foes.

See the streams of living watersSpringing from eternal love,Well supply thy sons and daughters,And all fear of want remove:Blest inhabitants of Zion,Washed in the Redeemer's blood!Jesus, whom their souls rely on,Makes them kings and priests to God.

Round each habitation hov'ring,See the cloud and fire appearFor a glory and a cov'ring,Showing that the Lord is near;Thus deriving from their bannerLight by night and shade by day,Thus they feed upon the mannaWhich He gives them when they pray. 

Savior, if of Zion's city I, thru grace, a member am,Let the world deride or pity,I will glory in Thy name;Fading is the worldling's pleasure,All his boasted pomp and show;Solid joys and lasting treasureNone but Zion's children know.
