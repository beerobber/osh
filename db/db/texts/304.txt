I need Thee ev’ry hour, Most gracious Lord;No tender voice like Thine Can peace afford.

I need Thee ev’ry hour, Stay Thou near by;Temptations lose their pow’r When Thou art nigh. 

I need Thee ev’ry hour, In joy or pain;Come quickly and abide, Or life is vain.

I need Thee ev’ry hour, Most Holy One;O make me Thine indeed, Thou blessed Son.





I need Thee, O I need Thee;Ev’ry hour I need Thee;O bless me now, my Savior!I come to Thee.
