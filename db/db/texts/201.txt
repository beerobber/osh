We are blessed in the law of the Lord; Undefiled in our walk on His way. We are blessed to keep thy testaments, Lord; With our whole heart we seek Him each day. 

We are blessed in the law of the Lord; All Thy precepts com manded to keep; The  direction, Lord, laid out in     Thy word, Is a map of the path for our feet.

We are blessed in the law of the Lord; Freed from sin as we walk in His ways. Teach us how to hear Thy judg ments, O, Lord; Teach the righteous to walk, Lord, we pray. 

I will never of Thee be ashamed; When I have that respect of Thy word: I will praise Thee with uprightness of heart; Oh, forsake not Thy children my Lord.
