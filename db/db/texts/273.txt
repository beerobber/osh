I care not today what the morrow may bring,If shadow or sunshine or rain;The Lord I know ruleth o’er everything,And all of my worry is vain.

Tho’ tempests may blow and the stormclouds arise,Obscuring the brightness of life;I’m never alarmed at the overcast skies,The Master looks on at the strife.

I know that He safely will carry me thru,No matter what evils betide;Why should I then care tho’ the tempests may blow,If Jesus walks close to my side.

Our Lord will return to this earth some sweet day,Our troubles will then all be o’er;The Master so gently will lead us away,Beyond that blest heavenly shore.





Living by faith in Jesus above,Trusting, confiding in His great love;From all harm safe in His sheltering arm,I’m living by faith and feel no alarm.

Yes, living by faith in Jesus above, Trusting, confiding yes, in His great love; From all harm safe His sheltering arm, I’m living by faith feel no alarm.
